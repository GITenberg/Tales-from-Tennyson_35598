<h2><a name="To_my_Young_Readers" id="To_my_Young_Readers"></a>To my Young Readers.</h2>

<p>Alfred Lord Tennyson was the typically English poet, and
none, perhaps not even Shakespeare, has appealed so keenly
to the human heart. No other man's poems have caused
as many readers to shed tears of sympathy nor have awakened
higher sentiments in the human heart. The critics
agree in pronouncing him the ideal poet laureate. In his
"Idylls from the King" are found the loftiest and proudest
deeds of English history and even in the retelling of these
in prose the high spirit that is an inspiration to the noblest
deeds cannot fail to be preserved.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_COMING_OF_KING_ARTHUR" id="THE_COMING_OF_KING_ARTHUR"></a>THE COMING OF KING ARTHUR.</h2>

<p>Over a thousand years ago everybody was talking about
the wonderful King Arthur and his brilliant Knights of
the Round Table, who everywhere were pursuing bold quests,
putting to rout the band of outlaws and robbers which in
those days infested every highway and by-way of the country,
going to war with tyrannical nobles, establishing law and
order among the rich, redressing the wrongs of women, the
poor and the oppressed, and winning glorious renown for
their valor and their successes.</p>

<p>That was in England which at that time was not England as
it is today, all one kingdom under a single ruler, but was
divided into many bits of kingdoms each with its own king
and all warring against each other. Arthur's kingdom was the
most unpeaceful of all. This was because for twenty years or
more, ever since the death of old King Uther, the country had
been without a ruler. Old King Uther had died about a
score of years before without leaving an heir to the throne,
and all the nobles of the realm had immediately gone to war
with one another each trying to get the most land and each
trying to get the throne for himself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus009.jpg" width="300" height="306" alt="OLD MERLIN APPEARS." title="OLD MERLIN APPEARS." />
<span class="caption">OLD MERLIN APPEARS.</span>
</div>

<p>Suddenly, however, old Merlin, the wizard who had been
King Uther's magician, appeared one day in the royal council
hall with a handsome young man, Arthur, and declared him to
be the king of the realm. Arthur was crowned and for a time
the nobles were quiet, for he ruled with a strong hand of iron,
put down all the evils in his kingdom and everywhere gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
it peace and order. People in every part of the island sent for
him and his knights, begging him to come to help them out
of their difficulties. But presently the nobles became troublesome
again; they said that Arthur was not the true king,
that he was not the son of
Uther and that, therefore,
he had no right to reign
over them. So there was
fighting and unrest again,
and in the midst of it
Leodogran, the king of
the Land of Cameliard,
asked Arthur to come with
his knights and drive away
the enemies besetting
him on every side. The
country of Cameliard had
gone to waste and ruin,
because of the continual
warfare that was waged with the kings that lived in the little
neighboring countries and a mass of wild-eyed foreign heathen
peoples who invaded the land. And so it happened that Cameliard
was ravaged with battles, its strong men were cut down
with the sword and wild dogs, wolves, and bears from the tangled
weeds came rooting up the green fields and wallowing
into the palace gardens. Sometimes the wolves stole
little children from the villages and nursed them like
their own cubs, until finally these children grew up into a race
of wolf-men who molested the land worse than the wolves
themselves. Then another king fought Leodogran, and at
last the heathen hordes came swarming from over the seas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and made all the earth red with his soldiers' blood, and they made
the sun red with the smoke of the burning homes of his people.</p>

<p>Leodogran simply did not know which way to turn for help
until at last he thought of young Arthur of the Round Table
who recently had been
crowned king. So Leodogran
sent for Arthur
beseeching him to come
and help him, for between
the men and the
beasts his country was
dying.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">PRINCESS GUINEVERE.</span>
</div>

<p>King Arthur and
his men welcomed the
chance and went at
once into the Land of
Cameliard to drive
away the heathen marauders.
As he marched
with his men past the
castle walls, pretty Princess
Guinevere stood
outside to watch the
glittering soldiers go by.
Among so many richly
dressed knights she
did not particularly notice
Arthur, for he wore nothing to show that he was king,
although his kingly bearing and brave forehead might suggest
leadership. But no royal arms were engraved upon his helmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
or his shield, and he carried simple weapons not nearly so
gorgeously emblazoned as those of some of the others.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img class="bbox" src="images/illus011.jpg" width="500" height="667" alt="HE LED HIS WARRIORS BOLDLY." title="HE LED HIS WARRIORS BOLDLY." />
<span class="caption">HE LED HIS WARRIORS BOLDLY.</span>
</div>

<p>Although Guinevere did not see the fair young King, Arthur
spied her beside the castle wall; he felt the light of her beautiful
eyes glimmering out into his heart and setting it all aflame
with a fire of love for her.</p>

<p>He led his warriors boldly to the forests where they pitched
their tents, then fought all the heathen until they scampered
away to their own territories, he slew the frightful wild beasts
that had plundered the fields, cut down the forest trees so as
to open out roads for the people of Cameliard to pass over from
one part of their land to the other, then he traveled quietly
away with his men, back to fight his own battles in his own
country. For there was fighting everywhere in those days.
But all the time in Arthur's heart, while he was doing those
wonderful things for Leodogran, he was thinking still, not of
Leodogran, but of the lovely Guinevere, and yearning for her.</p>

<p>If only she could be his queen he thought they two together
could rule on his throne as one strong, sweet, delicious life, and
could exert a mighty power over all his people to make them
good and wise and happy. Each day increased his love until
he could not bear even to think for a moment of living without
her. So from the very field of battle, while the swords were
flashing and clashing about him, as he fought the barons and
great lords who had risen up against him, Arthur dispatched
three messengers to Leodogran, the King of Cameliard.</p>

<p>These three messengers were Ulfius, Brastias and Bedivere,
the very first knight Arthur had knighted upon his throne.
They went to Leodogran and said that if Arthur had been of any
service to him in his recent troubles with the heathen and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
wild beasts, he should give the Princess Guinevere to be Arthur's
wife as a mark of his good will.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus013.jpg" width="400" height="447" alt="ARTHUR DISPATCHED THREE MESSENGERS TO LEODOGRAN." title="ARTHUR DISPATCHED THREE MESSENGERS TO LEODOGRAN" />
<span class="caption">ARTHUR DISPATCHED THREE MESSENGERS TO LEODOGRAN.</span>
</div>

<p>Well, when they had said this, Leodogran did not know what
to do any better than when the heathen and the beasts had
come upon him. For while he thought Arthur a very bold
soldier and a very fine man, and, although he felt very grateful
indeed to him for all the great things he had done, still he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
not certain that Guinevere ought to marry him. For, as
Guinevere was the daughter of a king she should become the
wife of none but the son of a king. And Leodogran did not
know precisely who this King Arthur was; but he did know
that the barons of Arthur's court had burst out into this
uproar against him because they said he was not their true
king and not the son of King Uther who had reigned before him.
Some of them declared him to be the child of Gerlois, and others
avowed that Sir Anton was his father.</p>

<p>As poor, puzzled Leodogran knew nothing about the matter
himself, he sent for his gray-headed trusty old chamberlain, who
always had good counsel to give him in any dilemma; and he
asked the chamberlain whether he had heard anything certainly
as to Arthur's birth. The chamberlain told him that there
were just two men in all the world who knew the truth with
respect to Arthur and where he had come from, and that both
these men were twice as old as himself. One of them was
Merlin the wizard, the other was Bleys, Merlin's teacher in
magic, who had written a book of his renowned pupil's wonders,
which probably related everything regarding the secret of
Arthur's birth.</p>

<p>"If King Arthur had done no more for me in my wars than
you have just now in my present trouble," the king answered
the chamberlain, "I would have died long ago from the wild
beasts and the heathen. Send me in Ulfius and Brastias and
Bedivere again."</p>

<p>So the chamberlain went out and Arthur's three men came
into Leodogran who spoke to them this way: "I have often
seen a big cuckoo chased by little birds and understood why
such tiny birds plagued him so, but why are the nobles in
your country rebelling against their king and saying that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
is not the son of a king. Tell me whether you yourselves
think he is the child of King Uther."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus015.jpg" width="400" height="408" alt="SIR KING, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF STORIES ABOUT THAT." title="SIR KING, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF STORIES ABOUT THAT." />
<span class="caption">SIR KING, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF STORIES ABOUT THAT.</span>
</div>

<p>Ulfius and Brastias answered immediately "yes," but
Bedivere, the first of all Arthur's knights, became very bold
when anyone slandered his sovereign and he replied: "<i>Sir
King, there are all sorts of stories about that</i>; some of the nobles
hate him just because he is good and they are wicked; they
cry out that he is no man because his ways are gentler than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
their rough manners, while others again think he must be
an angel dropped from heaven. But I will tell you the facts
as I know them, King Uther and Gerlois were rivals long ago;
they both loved Ygerne. And she was the wife of Gerlois and
had no sons, but three daughters, one of them the Queen of
Orkney who has clung to Arthur like a sister. The two rivals,
Gerlois and Uther went to war with each other and Gerlois
was killed in battle; then Uther quickly married the winsome
Ygerne, the widow of Gerlois, for he loved her dearly and impatiently.
In a few months Uther died, and on that very
night of his death Arthur was born. And as soon as he was
born they carried him out by a secret back gateway to Merlin
the magician, to be brought up far away from the court so
that no one would hear about him until he was grown up
ready to sit upon Uther's, his father, throne.</p>

<p>"For those were wild lords in those years just like these of
today, always struggling for the rule, and they would have
shattered the helpless little prince to pieces had they known
about him. So Merlin took the baby and gave him over to
old Sir Anton, a friend of Uther's, and Sir Anton's wife tended
Arthur with her own little ones so that nobody knew who he
was or where he had come from. But while the prince was
growing up the kingdom went to weed; the great lords and
barons were fighting all the time among themselves and nobody
ruled. But during this present year Arthur's time for ascending
the throne had come, so Merlin brought him from out of
his hiding place, set him in the palace hall and cried out to all
the lords and ladies, 'This is Uther's heir, your king!' Of
course, none of them would have that. A hundred voices cried
back immediately: 'Away with him! he is no king of ours, that's
the son of Gerlois, or else the child of Anton, and no king.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"In spite of this opposition Merlin was so crafty and clever he
won the day for the people, who were clamoring for a king and
were glad to see Arthur crowned. But after it all was over
the lords banded together and broke out in open war against
Arthur. That is the whole story of this war."</p>

<p>Although pleased with Bedivere's good account of Arthur,
yet when it was ended Leodogran scarcely felt satisfied. Was
Bedivere right, he thought to himself, or were the barons right?
As he sat pondering over everything in his palace, <i>three great
visitors came to the castle</i>; these were the Queen of Orkney,
the daughter of Gerlois and Ygerne, with her two sons, Gawain
and Modred. Leodogran
made a great feast for
them and while entertaining
them at table remembered
what Bedivere
had said about Arthur
and this queen. So he
turned to the queen and
remarked:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus017.jpg" width="300" height="404" alt="THREE VISITORS TO THE CASTLE." title="THREE VISITORS TO THE CASTLE." />
<span class="caption">THREE VISITORS TO THE CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>"An insecure throne is
no better than a mass of
ice in a summer's sea; it
all melts away. You are
from Arthur's court; tell
me, do you think this king
with his few loyal Knights
of the Round Table can
triumph over the rebellious
lords, and keep
his throne?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"O King, they are few indeed," the Queen of Orkney cried,
"but so bold and true, and all of one mind with him. I was
there at the coronation when the savage yells of the nobles
died away, and Arthur sat crowned upon the dais with all his
knights gathered round him to do his service for him forever.
Arthur in low, deep tones, with simple words of great authority
bound them to him with such wonderfully rigid vows that when
they rose from their knees one after the other, some of them
looked as pale as if a ghost had passed by them, others were
flushed in their faces, and yet others seemed dazed and blind
with their awe as if not fully awake. Then he spoke to them,
cheering them with divine words that are far more than my
tongue can ever tell you, and while he spoke every face flashed,
for just a moment with his likeness, and from the crucifix
above, three rays in green, blue, scarlet, streamed across upon
the bright, sweet faces of the three tall fair queens, his friends
who stood silently beside his throne, and who will always be
ready to help him if he is in need.</p>

<p>"Merlin, the magician, came there too, with his hundred
years of art like so many hands of vassals to wait upon the
young king. Near Merlin stood the mystical, marvelous Lady
of the Lake, who knows a deeper magic than Merlin's own,
dressed in white. A mist of incense curled all about her
and her face was fairly hidden in the dim gloom. But when
the holy hymns were sung a voice like flowing waters
sounded through the music. It was the voice of the Lady
of the Lake who lives in the lowest waters of the lake
where it is always calm, no matter what storms may blow
over the earth and who when the waves tumble and roll above
her can walk out upon their crests just as our Lord did.</p>

<p>"<i>It was she who gave Arthur his remarkable sword</i> Excalibur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
with its hilt like a cross wherewith he drove away the heathen
for you. That strange sword rose up from out the bosom
of the lake, and Arthur rowed over in a little boat and took it.
The sword is incrusted with rich jewels on the hilt, with a
blade so bright that
men are blinded by it.
On one side the words
'Take me' are graven
upon it in the oldest
language of the world,
while on the other side
the words 'Cast me
away' are carved in the
tongue that you speak.</p>

<p>"Arthur became very
sad when he saw the
second inscription, but
Merlin advised him to
take the beautiful blade
and use it; he told him
that now was the time
to strike and that the
time to cast away was
very, very far off. So
Arthur took the tremendous sword and with it he will beat
down his enemies, King Leodogran."</p>

<p>Leodogran was pleased with the queen's words, but he
wished to test the story Bedivere had told him, so he looked
into her eyes narrowly as he observed, with a question in his
tones, "The swallow and the swift are very near kin, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
are still closer to this noble prince as you are his own dear
sister."</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of Gerlois and Ygerne," she answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is why you are Arthur's sister," the king returned
still questioningly.</p>

<p>"These are secret things," the Queen of Orkney replied, and
she motioned with her hand for her two sons to leave her alone
in the room with the king.</p>

<p>Gawain immediately skipped away singing, his hair flying
after and frolicked outside like a frisky pony, <i>but cunning
Modred laid his ear close beside the door to listen</i>, so that he half
heard all the strange story his mother told the king. This is
what the queen said in the beginning to the king.</p>

<p>"What should I know about it?
For my mother's hair and eyes
were dark, and so were the eyes
and hair of Gerlois, and Uther
was dark too, almost black, but
the King Arthur is fairer than
anyone else in Britain. However,
I remember how my mother used
often to weep and say, 'O that
you had some brother, pretty little
one, to guard you from the
rough ways of the world."</p>

<p>"Yes? She said that?" Leodogran
rejoined, "but when did
you see Arthur first?"</p>

<p>"O king, I will tell you all
about it," cried the Queen of
Orkney. "Once when I was a little bit of a girl and had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
beaten for some childish fault that I had not committed, I ran
outside and flung myself on a grassy bank and hated all the
world and everything in it, and wished I were dead. But all
of a sudden little Arthur stood by my side. I don't know how
he came or anything about it. Perhaps Merlin brought him,
for Merlin, they say, can walk about and nobody see him, if
he will, but any rate, Arthur was there by my side, comforting
me and drying my tears. After that Arthur came very often
without anybody knowing it and we were children together, and
in those golden days I felt sure he would be king.</p>

<p>"But now I must tell you about Bleys, the old wizard who
taught the magician Merlin. You know they both served King
Uther, and just a little while ago when Bleys died he sent for
me. He said he had something to tell me that I must know
before he left the world. He said that they two, Merlin and
he, sat beside the bed of King Uther on the night when the
king passed away, moaning and wailing because he left no heir
to his throne. After the king's death as Merlin and Bleys
walked out from the castle walls into the dismal misty night,
they saw a wonderful fairy-ship shaped like a winged dragon
sailing the heavens, with shining people collected on its decks;
but in the twinkling of an eye the ship was gone.</p>

<p>"Then Merlin and Bleys passed down into the cove by the
seashore to watch the billows, one after the other, as they
lapped up against the beach. And as they looked at last a
great wave gathered up one-half of the ocean and came full
of voices, slowly rising and plunging, roaring all the while.
Then all the wave was in a flame; and down in the wave and
in the flame they saw lying a naked babe that was carried by
the water to Merlin's very feet.</p>

<p>"'The king!' cried Merlin. 'Here's an heir for Uther.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then as old Merlin spoke the fringe of that terrible great
flaming breaker lashed at him as he held up the baby; it rose
up round him in a mantle of fire so that he and the child were
clothed in fire. Then suddenly there was a calm, the stars
looked out and the sky was open.</p>

<p>"'And this same child,' Bleys whispered to me, 'is the young
king who reigns. And I could not die in peace unless the story
had been told.' Then Bleys passed away into the land where
nobody can question him.</p>

<p>"So I came to Merlin to ask him whether that was all true
about the shining dragon-ship and the tiny bare baby floating
down from heaven over on the glory of the seas; but Merlin
just laughed, as he always does, and answered me in the riddles
of the old song, this way:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Rain, rain and sun! a rainbow in the sky!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A young man will be wiser by and by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old man's wit may wander ere he die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain, rain and sun! a rainbow on the lea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And truth is this to me and that to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And truth or clothed or naked let it be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain, sun and rain! and the free blossom blows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sun, rain and sun! and where is he who knows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the great deep to the great deep he goes!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It vexed me dreadfully to have Merlin be so tantalizing; but
you must not be afraid, king, to give your only child Guinevere
to this King Arthur. For great poets will sing of his brave
deeds in long years after this; and Merlin has said, and not
joking, either, that even although Arthur's enemies may
wound him in battle he will never, never die, but will only pass
away for a time, for a little while, and then will come to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
again. And Merlin says too, that sometime Arthur is going
to trample all the heathen kings under his feet until all the
nations and all the men will call him their king."</p>

<p>It pleased Leodogran tremendously to hear what the Queen of
Orkney told him of Arthur, and when she had ended he lay
thinking over it all, still puzzled as to whether he should say
"yes" or "no" to the ambassadors whom Arthur had sent.
As he lay buried in his thoughts he grew very, very drowsy
and dreamy, and at last, he fell asleep. And while he slept
he saw a wonderful vision in a dream.</p>

<p>There was a strange, sloping land, rising before his eyes, that
ascended higher and higher, field after field, to a very great
height and at the top there was a lofty peak hidden in the
heavy, hazy clouds; and on the peak a phantom king stood.
One moment the king was there, and the next moment he was
gone, while everything below him was in a frightful confusion,
a battle with swords, and the flocks of sheep and cattle falling
back, and all the villages burning and their smoke rolling up
in streams to the clouded pinnacle of the peak where the king
stood in the fog, hiding him the more. Now and then the king
spoke out through the haze, and some one here or there beneath
would point upward toward him, but the rest all went on
fighting. They cried out, "He is no king of ours, no son of
Uther's, no king of ours." Then in a twinkling the dream
all changed; the mists had quite blown away, the solid earth
below the peak had vanished like a bubble and only the wonderful
king remained, crowned with his diadems, standing in the
heavens.</p>

<p>Then Leodogran while still looking at him woke from his sleep.
He called for Ulfius and Brastias and Bedevere, and when they
had come into this presence he told them that Arthur should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
marry the fair Princess Guinevere, and he sent them galloping
back to Arthur's court.</p>

<p>That was a joyful day for King Arthur when the three knights
delivered King Leodogran's message. He made ready at once
for his sweet queen. He picked out Lancelot, his favorite
Knight of the Round Table, whom he loved better than any
other man in all the world, to ride over into the Land of
Cameliard and bring back Guinevere for his bride. And as
Lancelot mounted his
dancing steed and rode
away <i>Arthur watched him
from the palace gates</i>,
thinking of the lovely
lady who would ride by
his side when he returned.</p>

<span class="caption">LANCELOT MOUNTED HIS DANCING STEED.</span>
</div>

<p>Lancelot's horse trampled
away among the
flowers; for it was April
when he left the court of
Arthur, and just one
month later he came
riding back among the
flowers of the May-time.
Guinevere was with him
on her graceful palfrey.</p>

<p>Then Dubric, the head
of the whole church in
Britain, went out to meet
her. Happy Arthur was
there too. They were
married in the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and noblest church in the land before the stately altar, with all
the Knights of the Round Table dressed in stainless white
clothes, gathered about them. And all the knights were as
delighted as they could be because their king was so glad.
Holy Dubric spread out his hands above the King and the
lovely Queen to call down the blessings of heaven, and he said:</p>

<p>"Reign, King, and live and love, and make the world better,
and may your queen be one with you, and may all the Knights
of the Order of the Round Table fulfill the boundless purposes
of their king."</p>

<span class="caption">KING ARTHUR AND THE LOVELY QUEEN.</span>
</div>

<p>There was spread a glorious marriage feast. Great lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
came thither from far away Rome, which once was the mistress
of all the world, but now was slowly fading away. These
Roman lords called for the tribute from Arthur that they had
always received from Britain ever since Cæsar with his Roman
legions had conquered it long years before.</p>

<p>But Arthur, the king and bridegroom, pointed to his snowy
knights and said: "These knights of mine have sworn to fight
for me in all my wars and to worship me as their king. The old
order of things has passed away and a new order will take its
place. We are fighting for our fair father Christ, while you
have been growing so feeble and so weak and so old that
you cannot even drive away the heathen from your Roman
walls any more. So we will not pay tribute to you nor be
your slaves. This is to be our own free country which we will
defend and maintain."</p>

<p><i>The great lords from Rome drew back very angrily</i> and went
home and told their king all about what Arthur had said. So
Arthur had to battle with Rome, but he won in the end.</p>

<p>Arthur trained his Knights of the Round Table so that they
all felt like one great, vast strong man, all of one will. Thus he
became mightier than any of the other kings in any part of
Britain. And when he fought with them he always conquered
them. In that way he drew in all the little kingdoms
under him, so that he was the one king of the land, and they all
fought together for him.</p>

<p>There were twelve great battles against the heathen hordes
that had molested them from across the terrible seas, and
each of these battles he won. So he made one great realm
and he reigned over it, the king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GARETH_AND_LYNETTE" id="GARETH_AND_LYNETTE"></a>GARETH AND LYNETTE.</h2>

<p>Old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent had three sons.
Gawain and Modred were Knights of the Round Table at
Arthur's court, and young Gareth, who was his mother's pet,
sighed to think he had to stay home and be cuddled and fondled
like a baby boy instead of riding off like a venturesome
soldier fighting gloriously for the king and winning a great
name.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried impatiently, one chilly spring day as he
stood by the brink of a rivulet and saw a bit of a pine tree
caught from the bank by the dashing, swollen waters of the
stream and whirled madly away. "That's the way the king's
enemies would fall before my spear, if I had a spear to use!
That stream can do no more than I can, even although it is
merely icy water all cold with the snows while I'm tingling with
hot blood and have strong arms. When Gawain came home
last summer and asked me to tilt with him and Modred was
the judge, didn't I shake him so in his saddle that he said I had
half overcome him? Humph! and mother thinks I'm still a
child!"</p>

<p><i>Gareth went in to the queen</i> and said: "Mother, if you love
me listen to a story I will tell. Once there was an egg which
a great royal eagle laid high above on the rocks somewhere
almost out of sight and there was a lad which saw the splendor
sparkling from it, and the lightnings playing around it and
the little birds crying and clashing in the nest. The boy
thought if he could only reach that egg he would be richer
than a houseful of kings, and he was nearly driven from his
sense with his desire for it. But whenever he reached to clamber
up for it some one who loved him restrained him saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
'If you love me do not climb, lest you break your neck.' So
the boy did not climb, mother, and he did not break his neck,
but he broke his heart pining for the glorious egg. How can
you keep me tethered here, Mother? Let me go!"</p>

<span class="caption">MOTHER, IF YOU LOVE ME LISTEN TO A STORY I WILL TELL.</span>
</div>

<p>"Have you no pity for me?" Queen Bellicent asked. "Stay
here by your poor old father and me; chase the deer in our fir
trees and marry some lovely bride I will get for you. You're my
best son and so young."</p>

<p>"Mother, a king once showed his son two brides and told him
that he must either win the beautiful one, or, if he failed, wed
the other. The pretty one was Fame and the other was
Shame. Why should I follow the deer when I can follow the
king? Why was I born a man if I cannot do a man's work?"</p>

<p>"But some of the barons say he isn't the true king."</p>

<p>"Hasn't he conquered the Romans and driven off the heathen
and made all the people free? Who has a right to be king if
not the man who has done that? He is the true king."</p>

<p>When Bellicent found that she could not turn Gareth from
his purpose, she said that if he was determined he must do
one thing before he asked the king to make him a knight.</p>

<p>"Anything," cried Gareth. "Give me a hundred proofs.
Only be quick."</p>

<p>The queen looked at him very slowly and said: "You are a
prince, Gareth, but before you are fit to serve the king you must
go into Arthur's court disguised and hire yourself to serve his
meats and drink among the scullions and kitchen knaves.
And you must not tell your name to anyone and you must
serve that way for a year and a day."</p>

<p>The queen made this condition, thinking that Gareth would
be too proud to play the slave. But he thought a moment, then
answered: "A slave may be free in his soul, and I can see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
jousts there. You are my mother so I must obey you and I
will be a scullion in King Arthur's kitchen and keep my name
a secret from everyone, even the king."</p>

<p>So Bellicent grieved and watched Gareth every moment
wherever he went, dreading the time when he should leave.
And he waited until one windy night when she slept, then called
two servants and slipped away with them, all three dressed
like poor peasants of the field.</p>

<p>They walked away towards the south and as they came to the
plain stretching to the mountain of Camelot, they saw the royal
city upon its brow. Sometimes its spires and towers flashed in
the sunlight; sometimes only the great gate shone out before
their eyes, or again the whole fair town vanished away. Then
the servants said:</p>

<p>"Let us go no further, Lord. It's an enchanted city, and all
a vision. The people say anyway, that Arthur isn't the true
king, but only a changeling from fairyland, and that Merlin
won his battles for him with magic."</p>

<p>Gareth laughed and replied that he had magic enough in his
blood and hopes to plunge old Merlin into the Arabian sea.
And he pushed them on to the gate. There was no other gate
like it under heaven. The Lady of the Lake stood barefooted
on the keystone and held up the cornice. Drops of water fell
from either hand and above were the three queens who were
Arthur's friends, and on each side Arthur's wars were pictured
in weird devices with dragons and elves so intertwined that
they made men dizzy to look at them. The servants cried out,
"Lord, the gateway is alive!" Then a blast of music pealed
out of the city, and the three queens stepped aside while an
old man with a long beard came out and asked:</p>

<p>"Who are you, my sons?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are peasants," answered Gareth, "who have come to
see the glories of your king, but the city looked so strange
through the morning mist that my men are wondering whether
it is not a fairy city or perhaps no city at all. So tell us the
truth about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a fairy city," the old man answered, "and a fairy
king and queen came out of the mountain cleft at sunrise
with harps in their hands and built it to music, which means it
never was built at all, and therefore built forever."</p>

<p>"Why do you mock me so?" Gareth cried angrily.</p>

<p>"I am not mocking you so much as you are mocking me and
every one who looks at you, for you are not what you seem, still
I know what you truly are."</p>

<p>Then the old man turned away and Gareth said to his men:
"Our poor little white lie stands like a ghost at the very beginning
of our enterprise. Blame my mother's love for it and
not her nor me."</p>

<p>So they all laughed and came into the city of Camelot with its
shadowy and stately palaces. Here and there a knight passed
in or out, his arms clashing and the sound was good to Gareth's
ears. Or out of a casement window glanced the pure eyes of
lovely women. But Gareth made at once for the hall of the
king where his heart fairly hammered into his ears as he wondered
whether Arthur would turn him aside because of the
half shadow of a lie he had told the old man by the gate about
being a peasant. There were many supplicants coming before
the king to tell him of some hurt done them by marauders or
the wild beasts, and each one was given a knight by the king
to help them.</p>

<p>When Gareth's turn came, he rested his arms, one on each
servant, and stepped forward saying: "A boon, Sir King!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Do you see how weak I seem, leaning on these men? Pray
let me go into your kitchen and serve there for a year and a day,
and do not ask me my name. After that I will fight for
you."</p>

<p>"You are a handsome youth," said the king, "and worth
something better from the king, but if that is what you wish,
go and serve under the seneschal, Sir Kay, Master of the Meats
and Drinks."</p>

<p>Sir Kay thought the boy had probably run away from the
farm belonging to some Abbey where he had not had enough to
eat, and he promised that if Gareth would work well he would
feed him until he was as plump as a pigeon.</p>

<p>But Lancelot, the king's favorite, said to Kay: "You don't
understand boys as well as dogs and cattle. Can't you see by
this lad's broad fair forehead and fine hands that he is nobly
born? Treat him well or he may shame you."</p>

<p>"Fair and fine, forsooth," cried Kay. "If he had been a
gentleman he would have asked for a horse and armor."</p>

<p>So he hustled and harried Garreth, <i>set him to draw water</i>, <i>hew
wood</i> and labor harder than any of the grimy and smudgy
kitchen knaves. Gareth did all with a noble sort of ease and
graced the lowliest act, and when the knaves all gathered
together of an evening to tell stories about Arthur on the
battlefields or of Lancelot in the tournament, Gareth listened
delightedly or made them all, with gaping mouths, listen
charmed, to some prodigious tale of his own about wonderful
knights cutting their scarlet way through twenty folds of
twisted dragons. When there was a Joust and Sir Kay let him
attend it, he went half beside himself in an ecstasy watching
the warriors clash their springing spears, and the sniffing
chargers reel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the first month, lonely Queen Bellicent felt
sorry for her poor, dear son, toiling and moiling among pots and
pans, so she sent a servant to Camelot with the beaming armor
of a knight and freed him from his vow. Gareth colored redder
than any young girl and went alone in to the king and told him
all.</p>

<span class="caption">SET HIM TO DRAW WATER, HEW WOOD.</span>
</div>

<p>"Make me your knight in secret," he begged Arthur, "and
give me the very next quest from your court!"</p>

<p>"Son," answered the king, "my knights are sworn to vows
of utter hardihood, of utter gentleness, of utter faithfulness in
love and of utter obedience to the king."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Gareth sprang lightly from his knees: "My king, I can
promise you for my hardihood; respecting my obedience, ask
Sir Kay, and as for love I have not loved yet, but God willing
some day I will, and faithfully."</p>

<p>The reply so pleased the great king, he laid his hand on
Gareth's arm and smiled and knighted him.</p>

<p>A few days later <i>a noble maiden</i> with a brow like a May-blossom
and a saucy nose <i>passed
into the king's hall with her page</i>
and told Arthur that her name
was Lynette, and that her beautiful
sister, the Lady Lyonors lived
in the Castle Perilous which was
beset with bandit knights.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="300" height="433" alt="A NOBLE MAIDEN WITH HER PAGE." title="" />
<span class="caption">A NOBLE MAIDEN WITH HER PAGE.</span>
</div>

<p>"A river courses about the castle
in three loops," said she, "each
loop has a bridge and every bridge
is guarded by a wicked outlaw
warrior, Sir Morning-star, Sir
Noon-sun and Sir Evening-star,
while a fourth called Death, a
huge man-beast of boundless
savageries, is besieging my sister
in her own castle so as to break
her will and make her wed with
him. They are four fools," cried the maiden disdainfully,
"but they are mighty men so I have come to ask for Lancelot to
ride away with me to help us."</p>

<p>Gareth was up in a twinkling with kindled eyes. "A boon,
Sir King, this quest," he cried. "I am only a knave from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
your kitchen, but I can topple over a hundred such fellows.
Your promise, king."</p>

<p>"You are rough and sudden and worthy to be a knight.
Therefore go," said Arthur to the great amazement of the
court.</p>

<p>"Fie on you, King!" exclaimed Lynette in a fury. "I asked
you for your best knight, Lancelot, and you give me a slave
from your kitchen," and she scampered down the aisle, leaped
to her horse and flitted out of the weird white gate. "A
kitchen slave!" she sputtered as she flew. "Why didn't the
king send me a knight that fights for love and glory?"</p>

<p>Gareth in the meantime had strode to the side doorway of
the royal hall where he saw a war-horse awaiting him, the gift
of Arthur and worth half the price of a town. His two servants
stood by with his shield and helmet and spear. Dropping his
coarse kitchen cloak to the floor, he instantly harnessed himself
in his armor, leaped to the back of his beautiful steed
and flashed out of the gateway while all his kitchen mates
threw up their caps and cried, "God bless the king and all his
fellowship!"</p>

<p>"Maiden, the quest is mine," he said to Lynette as he overtook
her, "Lead and I follow."</p>

<p>"Away with you!" she cried, nipping her slender nose.
"You smell of kitchen grease. See there, your master is
coming!"</p>

<p>Indeed she told the truth, for Sir Kay, infuriated with Gareth's
boldness in the king's hall was hounding after them. "Don't
you know me?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Yes, too well," returned Gareth. "I know you to be the
most ungentle knight in Arthur's court."</p>

<p>"Have at me, then," cried Kay, whereupon Gareth pounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
upon him with his gleaming lance and struck him instantly to
the earth, then turned for Lynette and said again, "Lead and
I follow."</p>

<p>But Lynette had hurried her galloping palfrey away and
would not stop the beast until his heart had nearly burst with
its violent throbbing. Then she turned and eyed Gareth as
scornfully as ever. As he pranced to her side she observed:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose scullion, that I think any more of you now
that by some good luck you have overthrown your master.
You dishwasher and water-carrier, you smell of the kitchen
quite as much as before."</p>

<p>"Maiden," Gareth rejoined gently, "Say what you will, but
whatever you say, I will not leave this quest until it is ended
or I have died for it."</p>

<p>"O, my, how the knave talks! But you'll soon meet with
another knave whom in spite of all the kitchen concoctions ever
brewed, you'll not dare look in the face."</p>

<p>"I'll try him," answered Gareth with a smile that maddened
Lynette. And away she darted again far into the strange
avenues of the limitless woods.</p>

<p>Gareth plunged on through the pine trees after her and a
serving-man came breaking through the black forest crying
out, "They've bound my master and are throwing him into
the lake!"</p>

<p>"Lead and I follow," cried Gareth to Lynette, and she led,
plunging into the pine trees until they came upon a hollow sinking
away into a lake, where six tall men up to their thighs in
reeds and bulrushes were dragging a seventh man with a stone
about his neck toward the water to drown him.</p>

<p>Gareth sprang upon three and stilled them with his doughty
blows, but three scurried away through the trees; then Gareth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
loosened the stone from the gentleman and set him on his feet.
He proved to be a baron and a friend of Arthur and asked
Gareth what he could do to show his gratitude for the saving of
his life. Gareth said he would like a night's shelter for the
lady who was with him. So they rode over toward the graceful
manor house where the baron lived, and as they rode he
said to Gareth.</p>

<p>"I believe you are of the Table," meaning that Gareth was a
Knight of the Round Table.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is of the table after his own fashion," Lynette
laughed, "for he serves in Arthur's kitchen." And turning
toward Gareth she added, "Do not imagine that I admire you
the more for having routed these miserable cowardly foresters;
any thresher with his flail could have done that."</p>

<p>And when they were seated at the baron's table, Gareth by
Lynette's side, she cried out to their host, "It seems dreadfully
rude in you, Lord Baron, to place this knave beside me. Listen
to me: I went to King Arthur's court to ask for Sir Lancelot
to come to help my sister, and as I ended my plea, up bawls
this kitchen boy: 'Mine's the quest.' And Arthur goes mad
and sends me this fellow who was made to kill pigs and not
redress the wrongs of women."</p>

<p>So Gareth was seated at another table and the baron came
to him and asked him whether it might not be better for him
to relinquish his quest, but the lad replied that the king had
given it to him and he would carry it through. The next
morning he said again to proud Lynette, "Lead and I follow."</p>

<p>But the maiden responded, "We are almost at the place
where one of the knaves is stationed. Don't you want to go
home? He will slay you and then I'll go back to Arthur and
shame him for giving me a knight from his kitchen cinders."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just let me fight," cried Gareth, "and I'll have as good luck
as little Cinderella who married the prince."</p>

<p>So they came to the first coil of the river and on the other
side saw a rich white pavilion with a purple dome and a slender
crimson flag fluttering above. The lawless Sir Morning-star
paced up and down outside.</p>

<p>"Damsel, is this the knight you've brought me?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Not a knight, but a knave. The king scorned you so he
sent some one from his kitchen."</p>

<p>"Come Daughters of the Dawn and arm me!" cried Sir
Morning-star, and three bare-footed, bare-headed maidens in
pink and gold dresses brought him a blue coat of mail and a
blue shield.</p>

<p>"A kitchen knave in scorn of me!" roared the blue knight.
"I won't fight him. Go home, knave! It isn't proper for you
to be riding abroad with a lady."</p>

<p>"Dog, you lie! I'm sprung from nobler lineage than you,"
and saying this, Gareth sprang fiercely at his adversary who
met him in the middle of the bridge. The two spears were
hurled so harshly that both knights were thrown from their
horses like two stones but up they leaped instantly. Gareth
drew forth his sword and drove his enemy back down the
bridge and laid him at his feet.</p>

<p>"I yield," Sir Morning-star cried, "don't kill me."</p>

<p>"Your life is in the hands of this lady," Gareth replied. "If
she asks me to spare you I will."</p>

<p>"Scullion!" Lynette cried, reddening with shame. "Do
you suppose I will ask a favor of you?"</p>

<p>"Then he dies," and Gareth was about to slay the wounded
knight when Lynette screamed and told him he ought not to
think of killing a man of nobler birth than himself. So Gareth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
said, "Knight, your life is spared at this lady's command.
Go to King Arthur's court and tell him that his kitchen knave
sent you, and crave his pardon for breaking his laws."</p>

<p>"I thought the smells of the odors of the kitchen grew fainter
while you were fighting on the bridge," Lynette remarked to
Gareth as he took his place behind her and told her to lead,
"but now they are as strong as ever."</p>

<p>So they rode on until they arrived at the second loop of the
river where the knight of the Noonday-Sun flared with his
burning shield that blazed so violently that Gareth saw scarlet
blots before his eyes as he turned away from it.</p>

<p>"Here's a kitchen knave from Arthur's hall who has overthrown
your brother," Lynette called across the river to him.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" returned Sir Noonday-Sun, raising his visor to reveal
his round foolish face like a cipher, and with that he pushed his
horse into the foaming stream.</p>

<p>Gareth met him midway and struck him four blows of his
sword. As he was about to deal the fifth stroke the horse of
the Noonday-Sun slipped and the stream washed his dazzling
master away. Gareth plucked him out of the water and sent
him back to King Arthur.</p>

<p>"Lead and I follow," he said to Lynette.</p>

<p>"Do not fancy," she rejoined, as she guided him toward the
third passing of the river, "that I thought you bold or brave
when you overcame Sir Noonday-Sun; he just slipped on the
river-bed. Here we are at the third fool in the allegory, Sir
Evening-star. You see he looks naked but he is only wrapped
in hardened skins that fit him like his own. They will turn
the blade of your sword."</p>

<p>"Never mind," Gareth said, "the wind may turn again and
the kitchen odors grow faint."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Lynette called to the Evening-star:</p>

<p>"Both of your brothers have gone down before this youth
and so will you. Aren't you old?"</p>

<p>"Old with the strength of twenty boys," said Sir Evening-star.</p>

<p>"Old in boasting," Gareth cried, "but the same strength
that slew your brothers can slay you."</p>

<p>Then the Evening-star blew a deadly note upon his horn and
a storm-beaten, russet, grizzly old woman came out and armed
him in a quantity of dingy weapons. The two knights clashed
together on the bridge and Gareth brought the Evening-star
groveling in a minute to his feet on his knees. But the other
vaulted up again so quickly that Gareth panted and half despaired
of winning the victory.</p>

<p>Then Lynette cried: "Well done, knave; you are as noble
as any knight. Now do not shame me; I said you would win.
Strike! strike! and the wind will change again."</p>

<p>Gareth struck harder, he hewed great pieces of armor from the
old knight, but clashed in vain with his sword against the hard
skin, until at last he lashed the Evening-star's sword and broke
it at the hilt. "I have you now!" he shouted, but the cowardly
knight of the Evening-star writhed his arms about the lad
till Gareth was almost strangled. Yet straining himself to the
uttermost he finally <i>tossed his foe headlong over the side of the
bridge</i> to sink or to swim as the waves allowed.</p>

<span class="caption">TOSSED HIS FOE OVER THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.</span>
</div>

<p>"Lead and I follow," Gareth said to Lynette.</p>

<p>"No, it is lead no longer," the maiden replied. "Ride beside
me the knightliest of all kitchen knaves. Sir I am ashamed
that I have treated you so. Pardon me. I do wonder who
you are, you knave."</p>

<p>"You are not to blame for anything," Gareth said, "except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
for your mistrusting of the king when he sent you some one
to defend you. You said what you thought and I answered
by my actions."</p>

<p>At that moment he
heard the hoofs of a horse
clattering in the road behind
him. "Stay!" cried
a knight with a veiled
shield, "I have come to
avenge my friend, Sir
Kay."</p>

<p>Gareth turned, and in a
thrice had closed in upon
the stranger, but when he
felt the touch of the
stranger knight's magical
spear, which was the wonder
of the world he fell to
the earth. As he felt the
grass in his hands he burst
into laughter.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?"
asked Lynette.</p>

<p>"Because here am I, the son of old King Lot and good Queen
Bellicent, the victor of the three bridges, and a knight of Arthur's
thrown by no one knows whom."</p>

<p>"I have come to help you and not harm you," said the
strange knight, revealing himself. It was Lancelot, whom
King Arthur had sent to keep a guardian eye upon young
Gareth in this his first quest, to prevent him from being killed
or taken away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why did you refuse to come when I wanted you, and
now come just in time to shame my poor defender just when
I was beginning to feel proud of him?" asked Lynette.</p>

<p>"But he isn't shamed," Lancelot answered. "What knight
is not overthrown sometimes? By being defeated we learn
to overcome, so hail Prince and Knight of our Round Table!"
"You did well Gareth, only you and your horse were a little
weary."</p>

<p>Lynette led them into a glen and a cave where they found
pleasant drinks and meat, and where Gareth fell asleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus043.jpg" width="400" height="341" alt="SHE TENDED HIM AS GENTLY AS A MOTHER." title="SHE TENDED HIM AS GENTLY AS A MOTHER." />
<span class="caption">SHE TENDED HIM AS GENTLY AS A MOTHER.</span>
</div>

<p>"You have good reason to feel sleepy," cried Lynette.
"Sleep soundly and wake strong." <i>And she tended him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
gently as a mother</i>, and watched over him carefully as he slept.</p>

<p>When Gareth woke Lancelot gave him his own horse and
shield to use in fighting the last awful outlaw, but as they drew
near Lynette clutched at the shield and pleaded with him:
"Give it back to Lancelot," said she. "O curse my tongue
that was reviling you so today. He must do the fighting now.
You have done wonders, but you cannot do miracles. You
have thrown three men today and that is glory enough. You
will get all maimed and mangled if you go on now when you
are tired. There, I vow you must not try the fourth."</p>

<p>But Gareth told her that her sharp words during the day
had just spurred him on to do his best and he said he must
not now leave his quest until he had finished. So Lancelot
advised him how best to manage his horse and his lance, his
sword and his shield when meeting a foe that was stouter than
himself, winning with fineness and skill where he lacked in
strength.</p>

<p>But Gareth replied that he knew but one rule in fighting and
that was to dash against his foe and overcome him.</p>

<p>"Heaven help you," cried Lynette, and she made her palfrey
halt. "There!" They were facing the camp of the Knight
of Death.</p>

<p>There was a huge black pavilion, a black banner and a black
horn. Gareth blew the horn and heard hollow tramplings to
and fro and muffled voices. Then on a night-black horse, in
night-black arms rode forth the dread warrior. A white
breast-bone showed in front. He spoke not a word which
made him the more fearful.</p>

<p>"Fool!" shouted Gareth sturdily. "People say that you
have the strength of ten men; can't you trust to it without
depending on these toggeries and tricks?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Knight of Death said nothing. Lady Lyonors at
her castle window wept, and one of her maids fainted away,
and Gareth felt his head prickling beneath his helmet and
Lancelot felt his blood turning cold. Every one stood aghast.</p>

<p>Then the chargers bounded forward and Gareth struck
Death to the ground. Drawing out his sword he split apart
the vast skull; one half of it fell to the right and one half to the
left. Then he was about to strike at the helmet when out of it
peeped the face of a blooming young boy, as fresh as a flower.</p>

<p>"O Knight!" cried the laddie. "Do not kill me. My three
brothers made me do it to make a horror all about the castle.
They never dreamed that anyone could pass the bridges."</p>

<p>Then Lady Lyonors with all her house had a great party of
dancing and revelry and song and making merry because the
hideous Knight of Death that had terrified them so was only
a pretty little boy. And there was mirth over Gareth's victorious
quest.</p>

<p>And some people say that Gareth married Lynette, but
others who tell the story later say he wedded with Lyonors.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MARRIAGE_OF_GERAINT" id="THE_MARRIAGE_OF_GERAINT"></a>THE MARRIAGE OF GERAINT.</h2>


<p>King Arthur had come to the old city of Caerleon on the
River Usk to hold his court, and was sitting high in his royal
hall when a woodman, all bedraggled with the mists of the
forests came tripping up in haste before his throne.</p>

<p>"O noble King," he cried, "today I saw a wonderful deer,
a hart all milky white running through among the trees, and,
nothing like it has ever been seen here before."</p>

<p>The king, who loved the chase, was very pleased and immediately
gave orders that the royal horns should be blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
for all the court to go a hunting after the beautiful white deer
the following morning. Queen Guinevere wished to go with
them to watch the hounds and huntsmen and dancing horses
in the chase. She slept late, however, the next day with her
pleasant dreams, and Arthur with his Knights of the Round
Table had sped gloriously away on their snorting chargers
when she arose, called one of her maids to come with her,
mounted her palfrey and forded the River Usk to pass over by
the forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">A WOODMAN ALL BEDRAGGLED CAME IN HASTE BEFORE HIS THRONE.</span>
</div><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>There they climbed up on a little knoll and stood listening
for the hounds, but instead of the barking of the king's dogs
they heard the sound of a horse's hoofs trampling behind them.
It was Prince Geraint's charger as he flashed over the shallow
ford of the river, then galloped up the banks of the knoll to her
side. He carried not a single weapon except his golden-hilted
sword and wore, not his hunting-dress, but gay holiday silks
with a purple scarf about him swinging an apple of gold at
either end and glancing like a dragon-fly. He bowed low to
the sweet, stately queen.</p>

<p>"You're late, very late, Sir Prince," said she, "later even
than we."</p>

<p>"Yes, noble queen," replied Geraint, "I'm so late that
I'm not going to the hunt; I've come like you just to watch
it."</p>

<p>"Then stay with me," the queen said, "for here on this little
knoll, if anywhere, you will have a good chance to see the
hounds, often they dash by at its very feet."</p>

<p>So Geraint stood by the queen, thinking he would catch
particularly the baying of Cavall, Arthur's loudest dog, which
would tell him that the hunters were coming. As they waited
however, along the base of the knoll, came a knight, a lady
and a dwarf riding slowly by on their horses. The knight
wore his visor up showing his imperious and very haughty
young face. The dwarf lagged behind.</p>

<p>"That knight doesn't belong to the Round Table, does he?"
asked the queen. "I don't know him."</p>

<p>"No, nor I," replied Geraint.</p>

<p>So the queen sent her maid over to the dwarf to find out
the name of his master. But the dwarf was old and crotchety
and would not tell her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I'll ask your master himself," cried the maid.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you shall not!" cried the dwarf, "you are not
fit even to speak of him," and as the girl turned her horse to
approach the proud young knight, the misshapen little dwarf
of a servant struck at her with his whip, and she came scampering
back indignantly to the queen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus048.jpg" width="400" height="409" alt="HE STRUCK OUT HIS WHIP AND CUT THE PRINCE&#39;S CHEEK." title="HE STRUCK OUT HIS WHIP AND CUT THE PRINCE&#39;S CHEEK." />
<span class="caption">HE STRUCK OUT HIS WHIP AND CUT THE PRINCE&#39;S CHEEK.</span>
</div>

<p>"I'll learn his name for you," Geraint exclaimed, and he
rode off sharply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>But the impudent dwarf answered just as before and when
Prince Geraint moved on toward his master he struck out his
whip and cut the prince's cheek so that the blood streamed
upon the purple scarf dyeing it red. Instantly Geraint reached
for the hilt of his sword to strike down the vicious little midget
but then remembering that he was a prince and disdaining to
fight with a dwarf, he did not even say a word, but cantered
back to Queen Guinevere's side.</p>

<p>"Noble Queen," he cried fiercely. "I am going to avenge
this insult that has been done you. I'll track these vermin to
the earth. For even although I am riding unarmed just now,
as we go along I will come to some place where I can borrow
weapons or hire them. And then when I have my man I'll
fight him, and on the third day from today I'll be back again
unless I die in the fight. So good-bye, farewell."</p>

<p>"Farewell, handsome prince," the queen answered. "Good
fortune in your quest and may you live to marry your first love
whoever that may be. But whether she will be a princess or a
beggar from the hedgerows, before you wed with her bring her
back to me and I will robe her for her wedding day."</p>

<p>Prince Geraint bowed and with that he was off. One minute
he thought he heard the noble milk-white deer brought to bay
by the dogs, the next he thought he heard the hunter's horn
far away and felt a little vexed to think he must be following
this stupid dwarf while all the others were at the chase. But
he had determined to avenge the queen and up and down the
grassy glades and valleys pursued the three enemies until at
last at sundown they emerged from the forest, climbed up
on the ridge of a hill where they looked like shadows against
the dark sky, then sank again on the other side.</p>

<p>Below on the other side of the ridge ran the long street of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
clamoring little town in a long valley, on one side a new white
fortress and on the other, across a ravine and a bridge, a fallen
old castle in decay. The knight, the lady and the dwarf rode
on to the white fortress, then vanished within its walls.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Geraint, "now I have him! I have tracked
him to his hole, and tomorrow when I'm rested I'll fight him."</p>

<p>Then he turned wearily down the long street of the noisy
village to look for his night's lodging, but he found every inn
and tavern crowded, and everywhere horses in the stables
were being shod and young fellows were busy burnishing their
master's armor.</p>

<p>"What does all this hubbub mean?" asked Geraint of one of
these youths.</p>

<p>The lad did not stop his work one instant, but went on
scouring and replied, "It's the sparrow-hawk."</p>

<p>As Prince Geraint did not know what was meant by the
sparrow-hawk he trotted a little farther along the street until
he came to a quiet old man trudging by with a sack of corn
on his back.</p>

<p>"Why is your town so noisy and busy to-night, good old
fellow?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Ugh! the sparrow-hawk!" the old fellow said gruffly.</p>

<p>So the prince rode his horse yet a little farther until he saw
an armor-maker's shop. The armor-maker sat inside with his
back turned, all doubled over a helmet which he was riveting
together upon his knee.</p>

<p>"Armorer," cried Geraint, "what is going on? Why is there
such a din?"</p>

<p>The man did not pause in his riveting even to turn about and
face the stranger, but said quickly as if to finish speaking as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
rapidly as he could, "Friend, the people who are working for
the sparrow-hawk have no time for idle questions."</p>

<p>At this Geraint flashed up angrily.</p>

<p>"A fig for your sparrow-hawk! I wish all the bits of birds
of the air would peck him dead. You imagine that this little
cackle in your baby town is all the noise and murmur of the
great world. What do I care about it? It is nothing to me.
Listen to me, now, if you are not gone hawk-mad like the rest,
where can I get a lodging for the night, and more than that,
where can I get some arms, arms, arms, to fight my enemy?
Tell me."</p>

<p>The hurrying armor-maker looked about in amazement to see
this gorgeous cavalier in purple silks standing before his bit of
a shop.</p>

<p>"O pardon me, stranger knight," said he very politely. "We
are holding a great tournament here tomorrow morning and
there is hardly any time to do one-half the work that has to be
finished before then. Arms, did you say? Indeed I cannot
tell you where to get any; all that there are in this town are
needed for to-morrow in the lists. And as for lodging, I don't
know unless perhaps at Earl Yniol's in the old castle across
the bridge." Then he again picked up his helmet and turned
his back to the prince.</p>

<p>So Geraint, still a wee mite vexed, rode over the bridge that
spanned the ravine, to go to the ruined castle. There upon the
farther side sat the hoary-headed Earl Yniol, dressed in some
magnificent shabby old clothes which had been fit for a king's
parties when they were new.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, son?" he queried of Geraint, waking
from his reveries and dreaminess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"O friend, I'm looking for some shelter for the night," Geraint
replied.</p>

<p>"Come in then," Yniol said, "and accept of my hospitality.
Our house was rich once and now it is poor, but it always keeps
its door open to the stranger."</p>

<p>"Oh, anything will do for me," cried Geraint. "If only
you won't serve me sparrow-hawks for my supper I'll eat with
all the passion of a whole day's fast."</p>

<p>The old earl smiled and sighed as he rejoined, "I have more
serious reason than you to curse this sparrow-hawk. But go
in and we will not have a word about him even jokingly unless
you wish it."</p>

<p>Whereupon Geraint passed into the desolate castle court,
where the stones of the pavement were all broken and overgrown
with wild plants, and the turrets and walls were shattered.
As he stood awaiting the Earl Yniol, the voice of a young girl
singing like a nightingale rang out from one of the open castle
windows.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Enid, Earl Yniol's daughter as she sang
the song of Fortune and her Wheel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turn, Fortune, thy wheel with smile or frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that wild wheel we go not up or down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The song of that little bird describes the nest she lives
in," cried Earl Yniol approaching. "Enter."</p>

<p>Geraint alighted from his charger and stepped within the
large dusky cobwebbed hall, where an aged lady sat, with Enid
moving about her, like a little flower in a wilted sheath of a
faded silk gown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enid, the good knight's horse is standing in the court,"
cried the earl. "Take him to the stall and give him some corn,
then go to town and buy us some meat and wine."</p>

<span class="caption">GERAINT STEPPED WITHIN THE DUSKY COBWEBBED HALL.</span>
</div>

<p>Geraint wished that he might do this servant's work instead
of this pretty young lady, but as he started to follow her the
old gray earl stopped him.</p>

<p>"We're old and poor," he said, "but not so poor and old as
to let our guests wait upon themselves."</p>

<p>So Enid fetched the wine and the meat and the cakes and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
bread; and she served at the table while her mother, father
and Geraint sat around. Geraint wished that he might stoop
to kiss her tender little thumb as it held the platter when she
laid it down.</p>

<p>"Fair host and Earl," he said after his refreshing supper,
"who is this sparrow-hawk that everybody in the town is
talking about? And yet I do not wish you to give me his
name, for perhaps he is the knight I saw riding into the new
fortress the other side of the bridge at the other end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the town. His name I am going to have from his own lips,
for I am Geraint of Devon. This morning when the queen
sent her maid to find out his name he struck at the girl with
his whip, and I've sworn vengeance for such a great insult
done our queen, and have followed him to his hold, and as
soon as I can get arms I will fight him."</p>

<p>"And are you the renowned Geraint?" cried Earl Yniol
beaming. "Well, as soon as I saw you coming toward me on
the bridge I knew that you were no ordinary man. By the
state and presence of your bearing I might have guessed
you to be one of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table at
Camelot. Pray do not suppose that I am flattering you
foolishly. This dear child of mine has often heard me telling
glorious stories of all the famous things you have done for the
king and the people. And she has asked me to repeat them
again and again.</p>

<p>"Poor thing, there never has lived a woman with such
miserable lovers as she has had. The first was Limours, who
did nothing but drink and brawl, even when he was making
love to her. And the second was the 'sparrow-hawk,' my
nephew, my curse. I will not let his name slip from me if
I can help it. When I told him that he could not marry
my daughter he spread a false rumour all round here among
the people that his father had left him a great sum of money
in my keeping and that I had never passed it over to him
but had retained it for myself. He bribed all my servants with
large promises and stirred up this whole little old town of
mine against me, my own town. That was the night of
Enid's birthday nearly three years ago. They sacked my
house, ousted me from my earldom, threw us into this dilapidated,
dingy old place and built up that grand new white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
fort. He would kill me if he did not despise me too much
to do so; and sometimes I believe I despise myself for letting
him have his way. I scarcely know whether I am very wise
or very silly, very manly or very base to suffer it all so patiently."</p>

<p>"Well said," cried Geraint eagerly. "But the arms, the
arms, where can I get arms for myself? Then if the sparrow-hawk
will fight tomorrow in the tourney I may be able
to bring down his terrible pride a little."</p>

<p>"I have arms," said Yniol, "although they are old and
rusty, Prince Geraint, and you would be welcome to have
them for the asking. But in this tournament of tomorrow
no knight is allowed to tilt unless the lady he loves best come
there too. The forks are fastened into the meadow ground
and over them is placed a silver wand, above that a golden
sparrow-hawk, the prize of beauty for the fairest woman
there. And whoever wins in the tourney presents this to the
lady-love whom he has brought with him. Since my nephew
is a man of very large bone and is clever with his lance he
has always won it for his lady. That is how he has earned
his title of sparrow-hawk. But you have no lady so you will
not be able to fight."</p>

<p>Then Geraint leaned forward toward the earl.</p>

<p>"With your leave, noble Earl Yniol," he replied, "I will
do battle for your daughter. For although I have seen all
the beauties of the day never have I come upon anything so
wonderfully lovely as she. If it should happen that I prove
victor, as true as heaven, I will make her my wife!"</p>

<p>Yniol's heart danced in his bosom for joy, and he turned
about for Enid, but she had fluttered away as soon as her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
had been mentioned, so he tenderly grasped the hands of her
mother in his own and said:</p>

<p>"Mother, young girls are shy little things and best understood
by their own mothers. Before you go to rest to night,
find out what Enid will think about this."</p>

<p>So the earl's wife passed out to speak with Enid, and Enid
became so glad and excited that she could not sleep the entire
happy night long. But very early the next morning, as soon
as the pale sky began to redden with the sun she arose, then
called her mother, and hand in hand, tripped over with her to
the place of the tournament. There they awaited for Yniol
and Geraint. Geraint came wearing the Earl's rusty, worn
old arms, yet in spite of them looked stately and princely.</p>

<p>Many other knights in blazing armor gathered there for
the jousts, with many fine ladies, and by and by the whole
town full of people flooded in, settling in a circle around the
lists. Then the two forks were fixed into the earth, above
them a wand of silver was laid, and over it the golden sparrow-hawk.
The trumpet was blown and Yniol's nephew
rose and spoke:</p>

<p>"Come forward, my lady," he cried to the maiden who had
come with him. "Fairest of the fair, take the prize of beauty
which I have won for you during the past two years."</p>

<p>"Stay!" Prince Geraint cried loudly. "There is a worthier
beauty here."</p>

<p>The earl's nephew looked round with surprise and disdain
to see his uncle's family and the prince.</p>

<p>"Do battle for it then," he shouted angrily.</p>

<p>Geraint sprang forward and the tourney was begun. Three
times the two warriors clashed together. <i>Three times they
broke their spears.</i> Then both were thrown from their horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
They now drew their swords; and with them lashed at one
another so frequently and with such dreadfully hard strokes
that all the crowd wondered. Now and again from the distant
walls came the sounds of applause, like the clapping of
phantom hands. The perspiration and the blood flowed
together down the strong bodies of the combatants. Each
was as sturdy as the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img class="bbox" src="images/illus058.jpg" width="500" height="691" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Remember the great insult done our queen!" Earl Yniol
cried at last.</p>

<p>This so inflamed Geraint that he heaved his vast sword-blade
aloft, cracked through his enemy's helmet, bit into
the bone of his head, felled the haughty knight, and set his
feet upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Your name!" demanded Geraint.</p>

<p>"Edryn, the son of Nudd," groaned the fallen warrior.</p>

<p>"Very well, then Edryn, the son of Nudd," returned Geraint,
"you must do these two things or else you will have to die.
First, you with your lady and your dwarf must ride to Arthur's
court at Caerleon and crave their pardon for the insult you
did the queen yesterday morning, and you must bide her
decree in the punishment she awards you. Secondly, you
must give back the earldom to your uncle the Earl of Yniol.
You will do these two things or you die."</p>

<p>"I will do them," cried Edryn. "For never before was I
ever overcome. But now all of my pride is broken down,
for Enid has seen me fall."</p>

<p>With that Edryn rose from the ground like a man, took his
lady and the dwarf on their horses to Arthur's court. There
receiving the sweet forgiveness of the queen, he became a
true knight of the Round Table, and at the last died in battle
while he fought for his king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>But Geraint when the tourney was over and he had come
back to the castle, drew Enid aside to tell her that early the
next morning he would have to start for Caerleon and that
she should be ready to ride away with him to be married at the
court with tremendous pomp. For that would be three days
after the King's chase, when the prince had promised Queen
Guinevere he would be back. But of that he did not speak
to Enid, who wondered why he was so bent on returning immediately,
and why she could not have time at home to prepare
herself some pretty robes to wear.</p>

<p>Imagine, she thought, such a grand and frightful thing as a
court, the queen's court, with all the graceful ladies staring at
her in that faded old silk dress! And although she promised
Geraint that she would go as he wished, when she woke to
the dread day for making her appearance at court, she still
yearned that he would only stay yet a little while so that
she could sew herself some clothes, that she had the flowered
silk which her mother had given her three years ago for her
birthday and which Edryn's men had robbed from her when
they sacked the house and scattered everything she ever
owned to all the winds. How she wished that handsome
Geraint had known her then, those three years ago when she
wore so many pretty dresses and jewels!</p>

<p>But while she lay dreamily thinking, softly in trod her
mother bearing on her arm a gorgeous, delicate robe.</p>

<p>"Do you recognize it, child?" she cried.</p>

<p>It was that self-same birthday dress, three years old, but
as beautiful as new and never worn.</p>

<p>"Yesterday after the jousts your father went through all the
town from house to house and ordered that all sack and plunder
which the men had taken from us should be brought back, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
he was again to be in his earldom. So last evening while you
were talking with the prince some one came up from the
town and placed this in my
hands. I did not tell you about
it then for I wished to keep it as
a sweet surprise for you this
morning. And it is a sweet surprise,
isn't it? For although the
prince yesterday did say that you
were the fairest of the fair there
is no handsome girl in the world
but looks handsomer in new
clothes than in old. And it
would have been a shame for you
to go to the court in your poor
old faded silk which you have
worn so long and so patiently.
The great ladies there might say
that Prince Geraint had plucked
up some ragged robin from the hedges."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus061.jpg" width="300" height="435" alt="BEARING A GORGEOUS ROBE." title="BEARING A GORGEOUS ROBE." />
<span class="caption">BEARING A GORGEOUS ROBE.</span>
</div>

<p>So Enid was put into the fine flowered robe.</p>

<p>Her mother said that after she had gone to the queen's
court, she, the poor old mother at home, who was too feeble
to journey so far with her daughter, would think over and
over again of her pretty princess at Camelot. And the old
gray Earl Yniol went in to tell Geraint of Enid's fanciful
apparel.</p>

<p>But Geraint was not delighted with the magnificence.</p>

<p>"Say to her," he answered the earl, "that by all my love
for her, although I give her no other reason, I entreat Enid
to wear that faded old silk dress of hers and no other."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>This amazing and hard message from Geraint made poor
little Enid's face fall like a meadowful of corn blasted by a
rainstorm. Still she willingly laid aside her gold finery for
his sake, slipped into the faded silk, and pattered down the
steps to meet Geraint. He scanned her so eagerly from her tip
to her toe that both her rosy cheeks burned like flames. Then
as he noted her mother's clouded face he said very kindly:</p>

<p>"My new mother don't be very angry, or grieved with your
new son because of what I have just asked Enid to do. I had
a very good reason for it and I will explain it all to you. The
other day when I left the queen at Caerleon to avenge the
insult done her by Edryn, the son of Nudd, she made me two
wishes. The one was that I should be successful with my
quest and the other was that I should wed with my first love.
Then she promised that whoever my bride should be she herself
with her own royal hands would dress her for her wedding
day, splendidly, like the very sun in the skies. So when I
found this lovely Enid of yours in her shabby clothes I vowed
that the queen's hands only should array her in handsome
new robes that befitted her grace and beauty. But never
mind, dear mother, some day you will come to see Enid and
then she will wear the golden, flowered birthday dress which
you gave her three years ago."</p>

<p>Then the earl's wife smiled through her tears, wrapped
Enid in a mantle, kissed her gentle farewells, and in a moment
saw her riding far, far away beside Geraint.</p>

<p>The queen Guinevere that day had three times climbed the
royal tower at Caerleon to look far into the valley for some
sign of Geraint, who had promised to be back that day, if he
did not fall in battle, and who would certainly come now,
since Edryn had been vanquished and had come to the court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
At last when evening had fallen she spied the prince's charger
pacing nobly along the road, and Enid's palfrey at his side.
Instantly Queen Guinevere sped down from the small window
in the high turret, tripped out to the gate to greet him and
embrace the lovely Enid as a long-loved friend.</p>

<p>The old City of Caerleon was gay for one whole week, over
the wedding week of Geraint and Enid. The queen herself
dressed Enid for her marriage like the very sunlight, Dubric,
the highest saint of the church, married them, and they
lived for nearly a year at the court with Arthur and sweet
Guinevere.</p>

<p>And so the insult done the queen was avenged, and her two
wishes were fulfilled. For Geraint overcame his enemy and
wedded with his first-love, dressed for her marriage by the
queen.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="GERAINTS_QUEST_OF_HONOR" id="GERAINTS_QUEST_OF_HONOR"></a>GERAINT'S QUEST OF HONOR.</h2>

<p>One morning Prince Geraint went into Arthur's hall and
said:</p>

<p>"O King, my princedom is in danger. It lies close to the
territory which is infested with bandits, earls and caitiff
knights, assassins and all sorts of outlaws. Give me your
kind good leave and I will go there to defend my lands."</p>

<p>The king said the prince might go, and sent fifty armed
knights to protect him and pretty Enid as they traveled away
on their horses across the Severn River into their own country,
the Land of Devon.</p>

<p>After Geraint had come into Devon he forgot what he had
said to the king of ridding his princedom of outlawry, he forgot
the chase where he had always been so clever in tracking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
game, forgot the tournament where he had won victory after
victory, forgot all his former glory and his name, forgot his
lands and their cares, forgot everything he ever did, and did
nothing at all but lie about at home and talk with Enid.
At last all his people began to gossip about their fine prince
who once had been illustrious everywhere and now had become
an idle stay-at-home who spent his time in making
love to his wife.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus064.jpg" width="400" height="572" alt="ENID HEARD OF GERAINT FROM HER HAIR-DRESSER." title="ENID HEARD OF GERAINT FROM HER HAIR-DRESSER." />
<span class="caption">ENID HEARD OF GERAINT FROM HER HAIR-DRESSER.</span>
</div>

<p>Enid heard of the tattling about Geraint from her hair-dresser,
and one morning as he lay abed, she went over it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to herself, talking aloud. She wished, that he would not
abandon all his knightly pursuits but would hunt and fight
again and add to his lustre. She felt very bashful about mentioning
the matter to him as she was very shy by nature and
lived in a time when wives were altogether over-ruled by
their husbands, yet to say nothing she thought would not be
showing herself a true wife to Geraint. All this and more
Enid went over to herself.</p>

<p>The drowsy prince, half awake, just half heard her and
quite misunderstood her meaning. When she said that in
keeping quiet about the gossip she was not a true wife to him
he supposed she meant that she no longer cared for him, that
he was not a handsome and strong enough man to suit her.
This grieved him deeply and made him very angry with her,
for Geraint had really given up all the glory of the king's
court just to be alone with Enid, although no one knew it.
And the thought that now she looked down upon him infuriated
all his heart. A word would have made everything right
but he didn't say it.</p>

<p>Springing up quickly from his bed he roused his squire and
said, "Get ready our horses, my charger and the princess'
palfrey. And you," turning a frowning face to the princess,
"put on the worst looking, meanest, poorest dress you have
and come away with me. We are going on a quest of honor
and then you will see what sort of soldier I am."</p>

<p>Enid wondered why her lord was so vexed with her and replied,
"If I have displeased you surely you will tell me why."</p>

<p>But Geraint would not say; he could not bear to speak of it.
So Enid hurried after her poor old faded silk gown with the
summer flowers among its folds, which she had worn to ride
from her old home to Caerleon, and hastily dressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not ride at my side," Geraint said as they both mounted
their horses to start away. "Ride ahead of me, a good way
ahead of me, and no matter what may happen, do not speak
a word to me, no not a word."</p>

<p>Enid listened, wondering what had come over her lord.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried as they were off, "we will make our way
along with our iron weapons, not with gold money." So
saying, he loosed the great purse which dangled from his
belt and tossed it back to his squire who stood on the marble
threshold of the doorway where the golden coins flashed and
clattered as they scattered every which-way over the floor.
"Now then, Enid, to the wild woods!"</p>

<p>At that they made for the swampy, desolated forest lands
that were famous for their perilous paths and their bandits,
Enid with a white face going before, Geraint coming gloomily
nearly a quarter of a mile after.</p>

<p>The morning was only half begun when the white princess
became aware that behind a rock hiding in the shadow stood
three tall knights on horseback, armed from tip to toe, bandit
outlaws lying in wait to fall upon whoever should pass. She
heard one saying to his comrades as he pointed toward
Geraint:</p>

<p>"Look here comes some lazy-bones who seems just about as
bold as a dog who has had the worst of it in a fight. Come,
we will kill him, and then we will take his horse and armor and
his lady."</p>

<p>Enid thought, "I'll go back a little way to Geraint and tell
him about these ruffians, for even if it will madden him I should
rather have him kill me than to have him fall into their hands."</p>

<p>She guided her palfrey backward and bravely met the frowning
face which greeted her, saying timidly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lord, there are three bandit knights behind a rock a
little way beyond us who are boasting that they will slay you
and steal your horse and armor and make me their captive."</p>

<p>"Did I tell you," cried Geraint angrily, "that you should
warn me of any danger. There was only one thing which I
told you to do and that was to keep quiet; and this is the way
you have heeded me! a pretty way! But win or lose, you shall
see by these fellows that my vigor is not lost."</p>

<p>Then Enid stood back as the three outlaws flashed out of
their ambush and bore down upon the prince.</p>

<p>Geraint aimed first for the middle one, driving his long spear
into the bandit's breast and out on the other side. The two
others in the meanwhile had dashed upon him with their
lances, but they had broken on his magnificent armor like so
many icicles. He now turned upon them with his broadsword,
swinging it first to the right and then to the left, first stunning
them with his blows, then slaying them outright. And when
all three had fallen he dismounted, and like a hunter skinning
the wild beasts he has shot, he stripped the three robber
knights of their gay suits of armor, and leaving the bodies lie,
bound each man's sword, spear and coat of arms to his horse,
tied the three bridle reins of the three empty horses together
and cried to Enid.</p>

<p>"Drive these on before you."</p>

<p>Enid drove them on across the wastelands, Geraint following
after. As she passed into the first shallow shade of the
forest she described three more horsemen partly hidden in the
gloom of three sturdy oak-trees. All were armed and one was
a veritable giant, so tall and bulky, towering above his companions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img class="bbox" src="images/illus068.jpg" width="500" height="693" alt="THE THREE OUTLAWS BORE DOWN UPON THE PRINCE." title="THE THREE OUTLAWS BORE DOWN UPON THE PRINCE." />
<span class="caption">THE THREE OUTLAWS BORE DOWN UPON THE PRINCE.</span>
</div>

<p>"See there, a prize!" bellowed the giant and set Enid's pulses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in a quiver. "Three horses and three suits of armor, and all
in charge of&mdash;whom? A girl! Isn't that simple? Lay on,
my men!"</p>

<p>"No," cried the second, "behind is coming a knight. A
coward and a fool, for see how he hangs his head."</p>

<p>The giant thundered back gaily.</p>

<p>"Yes? Only one? Wait here and as he goes by make for
him."</p>

<p>"I will go no farther until Geraint comes," Enid said to herself
stopping her horse. "And then I will tell him about
these villains. He must be so weary with his other fight and
they will fall upon him unawares. I shall have to disobey him
again for his own sake. How could I dare to obey him and
let him be harmed? I must speak; if he kills me for it I shall
only have lost my own life to save a life that is dearer to me
than my own."</p>

<p>So she waited until the prince approached when she said
with a timid firmness, "Have I your leave to speak?"</p>

<p>"You take it without asking when you speak," he replied,
and she continued:</p>

<p>"There are three men lurking in the woods behind some oaks
and one of them is larger than you, a perfect giant. He told
them to attack you as you passed by them."</p>

<p>"If there were a hundred men in the wood and each of them
a giant and if they all made for me together I vow it would not
anger me so as to have you disobey me. Stand aside while
we do battle and when we are done stand by the victor."</p>

<p>At this, while Enid fell back breathing short fits of prayer
but not daring to watch, Geraint proceeded to meet his assailants.
The giant was the first to dash out for him aiming his
lance at Geraint's helmet, but the lance missed and went to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
side. Geraint's spear had been a little strained with his
first encounter, but it struck through the bulky giant's corselet
and pierced his breast, then broke, one-half of it still fast
in the flesh as the giant knight fell to the earth. The other two
bandits now felt that their support and hero was gone, and
when Geraint darted rapidly on them, uttering his terrible
warcry as if there were a thousand men behind him to come
to his aid, they flew into the woods. But they were soon
overtaken and pitilessly put to death. Then Geraint, selecting
the best lance, the brightest and strongest among their spears
to replace the one he had broken on the giant, he plucked off
the gaudy armor from each brigand's body, laid it on the backs
of the three horses, tied the bridle reins together and handed
them to Enid with the words, "Drive them on before you."</p>

<p>So Enid now followed the wild paths of the gloomy forest
with two sets of three horses, each horse laden with his master's
jingling weapons and coat of mail. Geraint came after. As
they passed out of the wood into the open sky they came to a
little town with towers upon a rocky hill, and beneath it a wide
meadowland with mowers in it, mowing the hay. Down a
stony pathway from the town skipped a fair-haired lad carrying
a basket of lunch for the laborers in the field.</p>

<p>"Friend!" cried Geraint, as the lad trotted past him, for he
saw that Enid looked very white, "let my lady have something
to eat. She is so faint."</p>

<p>"Willingly," the youth answered, "and you too, my lord,
even although this feed is very coarse and only fit for the
mowers."</p>

<p>He set down his basket and Enid and Geraint alighted and
put all the horses to graze, while they sat down on the green
sward to have some bread and barley. Enid felt too faint at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
heart, thinking of the prince's strange conduct, to care a great
deal for food, but Geraint was hungry enough and had all the
mowers' basket emptied almost before he knew it.</p>

<p>"Boy," he cried half-ashamed, "everything is gone, which
is a disgrace. But take one of my horses and his arms by way
of payment, choose the very best."</p>

<p>The poor lad, who might as well have had a kingdom given
him, reddened with his extreme surprise and delight.</p>

<p>"My lord, you are over-paying me fifty times," he cried.</p>

<p>"You will be all the wealthier then," returned the prince,
gaily.</p>

<p>"I'll take it as free gift, then," the lad answered. "The
food is not worth much. While your lady is resting here I can
easily go back and fetch more, some more for the earl's mowers.
For all these mowers belong to our great earl, and all
these fields are his, and I am his, too. I'll tell him what a
fine man you are, and he will have you to his palace and serve
you with costly dinners."</p>

<p>"I wish no better fare than I have had," Geraint said, "I
never ate better in my life than just now when I left your
poor mowers dinnerless. And I will go into no earl's palace.
If he desires to see me, let him come to me. Now you go hire
us some pleasant room in the town, stall our horses and when
you return with the food for these men tell us about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, my kind lord," the glad youth cried, and he held his
head high and thought he was a gorgeous knight off to the
wars as he disappeared up the rocky path leading his handsome
horse.</p>

<p>The prince turned himself sleepily to watch the lusty
mowers laboring under the sun as it blazed on their scythes,
while Enid plucked the long grass by the meadows' edge to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
weave it round and round her wedding ring, until the boy returned
and showed them the room he had got in the town.</p>

<p>"If you wish anything, call the woman of the house,"
Prince Geraint said to Enid as the door closed behind them.
"Do not speak to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," returned Enid, still marvelling at his cold
ways.</p>

<p>Silently they sat down, she at one end, he at the other, as
quiet as pictures. But suddenly a mass of voices sounded up
the street, and heel after heel echoing upon the pavement.
In a twinkling the door to their room was pushed back to the
wall while a mob of boisterous young gentlemen tumbled in
led by the Earl of Limours, the wild lord of the town, and
Enid's old suitor whom her father had rejected long ago, a
man as beautiful as a woman and very graceful. He seized
the prince's hand warmly, welcomed him to the town and
stealthily, out of the corner of his eye, caught a glimpse of
unhappy Enid nestled all alone at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>The prince immediately sent for every sort of delicious
things to eat and drink from the town, told the earl, to bid
all his friends for a feast and soon was gaily making merry
with the men, drinking, laughing, joking.</p>

<p>"May I have your leave, my lord," cried Earl Limours, "to
cross the room and speak a word with your lady who seems
so lonely?"</p>

<p>"My free leave," cried the merry Prince Geraint, who did
not know the earl, "Get her to speak with you; she has nothing
to say to me."</p>

<p>As Limours stepped to Enid's side he lifted his eyes adoringly,
bowed at her side and said in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Enid, you pilot star of my life, I see that Geraint is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
unkind to you and loves you no longer. What a laughing
stock he is making of you with that wretched old dress you
have on! But I, I love you still as always. Just say the word
and I will have him put into the keep and you will come with
me. I will be kind to you forever."</p>

<p>The tears fluttered into the earl's eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Earl," replied Enid, "if you love me as you used to do in
the years long ago, and are not joking now, come in the morning
and take me by force from the prince. But leave me tonight.
I am wearied to death."</p>

<p>So the earl made a low bow, brandishing his plumes until
they brushed his very insteps, while the stout prince bade
him a loud good night,
and he moved away talking
to his men.</p>

<span class="caption">THE EARL MADE A LOW BOW.</span>
</div>

<p>But as soon as he was
gone Enid began to plan
how she could escape with
Geraint before Earl Limours
should come after her
in the morning. She was
too afraid of Geraint to
speak with him about it,
but when he had fallen
asleep she stepped lightly
about the room and
gathered the pieces of his armor together in one place
ready for an early departure on the morrow. Then she
dropped off into slumber. But suddenly she heard a loud
sound, the earl with his wild following blowing his trumpet
to call her to come out, she thought. But it was only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
great red cock in the yard below crowing at the daylight
which had begun to glimmer now across the heap of
Geraint's armor. She rose immediately in her fright to see
that all was well, went over to examine the weapons and unwittingly
let the casque fall jangling to the floor. This woke
Geraint, who started up and stared at her.</p>

<p>"My lord," began Enid, and then she told him all that Earl
Limours had said to her and how she had put him off by telling
him to come this morning.</p>

<p>"Call the woman of the house and tell her to bring the
charger and the palfrey," Geraint cried angrily. "Your
sweet face makes fools of good fellows." Geraint loved Enid
still and he was in as great perplexity as she, for after misunderstanding
what she had said he no more knew whether
she cared for him truly than she knew what was troubling
him and making him act in this unaccountable manner.</p>

<p>Enid slipped through the sleeping household like a ghost
to deliver the prince's message to the landlord, hurried back
to help Geraint with his armor and came down with him to
spring upon her palfrey.</p>

<p>"What do I owe you, friends?" the prince asked his host,
but before the man could reply he added "take those five
horses and their burdens of arms."</p>

<p>"My lord, I have scarcely spent the price of one of them on
you!" cried the landlord astonished.</p>

<p>"You'll have all the more riches then," the prince laughed,
then turning to Enid, "today I charge you more particularly
than ever before that whatever you may see, hear, fancy or
imagine, do not speak to me, but obey."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," answered Enid, "I know your wish and
should like to obey, but when I go riding ahead, I hear all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
violent threats you do not hear and see the danger you cannot
see, and then not to give you warning seems hard, almost
beyond me. Yet, I wish to obey you."</p>

<p>"Do so, then," said he. "Do not be too wise, seeing that
you are married, not to a clown but a strong man with arms to
guard his own head and yours, too."</p>

<p>The broad beaten path which they now took passed through
toward the wasted lands bordering on the castle of Earl Doorm,
the Bull, as his people called him, because of his ferocity.</p>

<p>It was still early morning when Enid caught the sound of
quantities of hoofs galloping up the road. Turning round she
saw cloudsful of dust and the points of lances sparkling in it.
Then, not to disobey the prince, yet to give him warning, she
held up her finger and pointed toward the dust. Geraint was
pleased at her cunning, and immediately stopped his horse.
The moment after, the Earl of Limours dashed in upon him on
a charger as black and as stormy as a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>Geraint closed with the earl, bore down on him with his spear,
and in a minute brought him stunned or dead to the ground.
Then he turned to the next-comer after Limours, overthrew
him and blindly rushed back upon all the men behind. But
they were so startled at the flash and movement of the prince
that they scrambled away in a panic, leaving their leader lying
on the public highway. The horses also of the fallen warriors
whisked off from their wounded masters and wildly flew away
to mix with the vanishing mob.</p>

<p>"Horse and man, all of one mind," remarked Geraint,
smiling, "not a hoof of them left. What do you say, Enid,
shall we strip the earl and pay for a dinner or shall we fast?
Fast? Then go on and let us pray heaven to send us some Earl
of Doorm's men so that we can earn ourselves something to eat."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Enid sadly eyed her bridle-reins and led the way, Geraint
coming after, scarcely knowing that he had been pricked by
Limours in his side, and that he was bleeding secretly beneath
his armor. But at last his head and helmet began to wag unsteadily,
and at a sudden swerving of the road he was tossed
from his horse upon a bank of grass. Enid heard the clashing
of the fall, and too terrified to cry out, came back all pale. Then
she dismounted, loosed the fastenings of his armor and bound
up his wounds with her veil. Then she sat down desolately
and began to cry, wondering what ever she should do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus076.jpg" width="400" height="459" alt="ENID SAT DOWN DESOLATELY AND BEGAN TO CRY." title="ENID SAT DOWN DESOLATELY AND BEGAN TO CRY." />
<span class="caption">ENID SAT DOWN DESOLATELY AND BEGAN TO CRY.</span>
</div>

<p>Many men passed by but no one took any notice of her. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in that lawless, turbulent earldom no one minded a woman
weeping for a murdered lover than they now mind a summer
shower. One man scurrying as fast as ever he could travel
toward the bandit earl's castle, drove the sand sweeping into
her poor eyes, and another coming in the opposite direction
from out the earl's castle park in seeming hot haste, turned
all the long dusty road into a column of smoke behind him,
and frightened her little palfrey so that it scoured off into
the coppices and was lost. But the prince's charger stood
beside them and grieved over the mishap like a man.</p>

<p>At noon a huge warrior with a big face and russet beard and
eyes rolling about in search of prey, came riding hard by with
a hundred spearmen at his back all bound for some foray. It
was the frightful Earl Doorm.</p>

<p>"What, is he dead?" cried the earl loudly to Enid, as he
spied her on the wayside.</p>

<p>"No, no, not dead," she quickly answered. "Would
some of your kind people take him up and bear him off somewhere
out of this cruel sun? I am very sure, quite sure that
he is not dead."</p>

<p>"Well, if he isn't dead, why should you cry for him so?
Dead or not dead, you just spoil your pretty face with idiotic
tears. They will not help him. But since it is a pretty face,
come fellows, some of you, and take him to our hall. If he lives
he will be one of our band, and if not, why there is earth enough
to bury him in. See that you take his charger, too, a noble
one."</p>

<p>And so saying, the rude earl passed on, while two brawny
horsemen came forward growling to think they might lose their
chance of booty from the morning's raid all for this dead man.
They raised the prince upon a litter, laying him in the hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of his shield, and brought him into the barren hall of Doorm,
while Enid and the gentle charger followed after. They tossed
him and his litter down on an oaken settle in the hall, and then
shot away for the woods.</p>

<p>Enid sat through long hours all alone with Geraint besides
the oaken settle, propping his head and chafing his hands, but
in the late afternoon she saw the huge Earl Doorm returning
with his lusty spearmen and their plunder. Each hurled
down a heap of spoils on the floor, threw aside his lance and
doffed his helmet, while a tribe of brightly gowned gentle-women
fluttered into the hall and began to talk with them.
Earl Doorm struck his knife against the table and bellowed for
meat, and wine. In a moment the place fairly steamed and
smoked with whole roast hogs and oxen, and everybody sat
down in a hodge-podge and ate like cattle feeding in their stalls,
while Enid shrank far back startled, into her nook.</p>

<p>But suddenly, when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would, and
all he could for the moment, he revolved his eyes about the
bare hall and caught a glimpse of the fair little lady drooping
in her niche. Then he recollected how she had crouched weeping
by the roadside for her fallen lord that morning. A wild
pity filled his gruff heart.</p>

<p>"Eat, eat!" he shouted. "I never before saw any thing so
pale. Be yourself. Isn't your lord lucky, for were I dead who
is there in all the world who would mourn for me? Sweet lady,
never have I ever seen a lily like you. If there were a bit of
color living in your cheeks there is not one among my gentle-women
here who would be fit to wear your slippers for gloves.
But listen to me and you will share my earldom with me, girl,
and we will live like two birds in a nest and I will bring you all
sorts of finery from every part of the world to make you happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>"</p>

<p>As the earl spoke his two cheeks bulged with the two tremendous
morsels of meat which he had tucked into his mouth.</p>

<p>Enid was more alarmed than ever.</p>

<p>"How can I be happy over anything," replied she, "until
my lord is well again?"</p>

<p>The earl laughed, then plucked her up out of the corner, carried
her over to the table, thrust a dish of food before her and
held a horn of wine to her lips.</p>

<p>"By all heaven," cried Enid, "I will not drink until my lord
gets up and drinks and eats with me. And if he will not rise
again I will not drink any wine until I die."</p>

<p>At this the earl turned perfectly red and paced up and down
the hall, gnawing first his upper and then his lower lip.</p>

<p>"Girl," shouted he, "why wail over a man who shames your
beauty so, by dressing it in that rag? Put off those beggar-woman's
weeds and robe yourself in this which my gentle-woman
has brought you."</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous, wonderful dress, colored in the tints of a
shallow sea with the blue playing into the green, and gemmed
with precious stones all down the front of it as thick as dewdrops
on the grass. But Enid was harder to move than any cold
tyrant on his throne, and said:</p>

<p>"Earl, in this poor gown my dear lord found me first and loved
me while I was living with my father; in this poor gown I rode
with him to court and was presented to the queen; in this poor
gown he bade me ride as we came out on this fatal quest of
honor, and in this poor gown I am going to stay until he gets up
again, a live, strong man, and tells me to put it away. I have
griefs enough, pray be gentle with me, let me be. O God! I
beg of your gentleness, since he is as he is, to let me be."</p>

<p>Then the brutal earl strode up and down the hall and cried out:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is of no more use to be gentle with you than to be rough.
So take my salute," and with that he slapped her lightly on her
white cheek.</p>

<p>Enid shrieked. Instantly the fallen Geraint was up on his
feet with the sword that had laid beside him in the hollow of
the shield, making a single bound for the earl, and with one
sweep of it sheared through the swarthy neck. The rolling
eyes turned glassy, the russet-bearded head tumbled over the
floor like a ball, and all the bandit knights and the gentle-women
in the hall flitted, scampering pell-mell away, yelling
as if they had seen a ghoul. Enid and Geraint were left alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus080.jpg" width="400" height="386" alt="THE RUSSET-BEARDED HEAD TUMBLED OVER THE FLOOR LIKE A BALL."
title="THE RUSSET-BEARDED HEAD TUMBLED OVER THE FLOOR LIKE A BALL." />
<span class="caption">THE RUSSET-BEARDED HEAD TUMBLED OVER THE FLOOR LIKE A BALL.</span>
</div>

<p>Now Geraint had come out of his swoon before the earl had
returned, and he had lain perfectly silent and immovable because
he wished to test Enid and see what she would do when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
she thought he was sleeping or fainted away, or perhaps dead.
So he had listened to all that had taken place and had heard
everything that Earl Doorm had said to her and all that Enid
had replied, so now he knew that she loved him as ever and that
she stood steadfast by him. All his heart filled with pity and
remorse that he had brought her away on this hard, hard quest,
and had made her suffer so much and had been so rough and
cold.</p>

<p>"Enid," said the prince tenderly, very tenderly. "I have
used you worse than that big dead brute of a man used you.
I have done you more wrong than he. I misunderstood you.
Now, now you are three times mine."</p>

<p>Geraint's kindness burst upon Enid so abruptly and was so
unforeseen that she could not speak a word only this:</p>

<p>"Fly, Geraint, they will kill you, they will come back. Fly.
Your horse is outside, my poor little thing is lost."</p>

<p>"You shall ride behind me, then, Enid."</p>

<p>So they slipped quickly outside, found the stately charger
and mounted him, first Geraint, then Enid, climbing up the
prince's feet, and throwing her arms about him to hold herself
firm as they bounded off.</p>

<p>But as the horse dashed outside of the earl's gateway there
before them in the highroad stood a knight of Arthur's court
holding his lance as if ready to spring upon Geraint.</p>

<p>"Stranger!" shrieked Enid, thinking of the prince's wound
and loss of blood, "do not kill a dead man!"</p>

<p>"The voice of Enid!" cried the stranger knight.</p>

<p>Then Enid saw that he was Edryn, the son of Nudd, and
feeling the more terrified as she remembered the jousts, cried
out:</p>

<p>"O, cousin, this is the man who spared your life!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">BEFORE THEM IN THE HIGHROAD STOOD A KNIGHT OF ARTHUR&#39;S COURT.
</span>
</div>

<p>Edryn stepped forward. "My lord Geraint," he said, "I took
you for some bandit knight of Doorm's. Do not fear, Enid,
that I will attack the prince. I love him. When he overthrew
me at the lists he threw me higher. For now I have
been made a Knight of the Round Table and am altogether
changed. But since I used to know Earl Doorm in the old
days when I was lawless and half a bandit myself, I have come
as the mouthpiece of our king to tell Doorm to disband all his
men and become subject to Arthur, who is now on his way
hither."</p>

<p>"Doorm is now before the King of Kings," Geraint replied,
"And his men are already scattered," and the prince pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to groups in the thickets or still running off in their panic. Then
back to the people all aghast whom they could see huddling, he
related fully to Edryn how he had slain the huge earl in his own
hall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus083.jpg" width="400" height="529" alt="TO THE ROYAL CAMP WHERE ARTHUR CAME OUT TO GREET THEM."
title="TO THE ROYAL CAMP WHERE ARTHUR CAME OUT TO GREET THEM." />
<span class="caption">TO THE ROYAL CAMP WHERE ARTHUR CAME OUT TO GREET THEM.</span>
</div>

<p>"Come with me to the king," astonished Edryn said.</p>

<p>So they all traveled off to the royal camp where Arthur himself
came out to greet them, lifted Enid from her saddle, kissed
her and showed her a tent where his own physician came in to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
attend to Geraint's wound. When that was healed he rode
away with them to Caerleon for a visit with Queen Guinevere,
who dressed Enid again in magnificent clothes. Then fifty
armed knights escorted Enid and the prince as far as the banks
of the Severn River, where they crossed over into the land of
Devon. And all their people welcomed them back.</p>

<p>Geraint after that never forgot his princedom or the tournament,
but was known through all the country round as the
cleverest and bravest warrior, while his princess was called
Enid the Good.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="MERLIN_AND_VIVIEN" id="MERLIN_AND_VIVIEN"></a>MERLIN AND VIVIEN.</h2>

<p>Vivien was a very clever, wily and wicked woman, who
wanted to become a greater magician than even the great Merlin,
who was the most famous man of all his times, who understood
all the arts, who had built the king's harbors, ships and halls,
who was a fine poet and who could read the future in the stars
in the skies.</p>

<p>He had once told Vivien of a charm that he could work to
make people invisible. Whenever he worked it upon anyone
that person would seem to be imprisoned within the four walls
of a tower and could not get out. The person would seem dead,
lost to every one, and could be seen only by the person who
worked the charm. Vivien yearned to know what the charm
was, for she wanted to cast its spell on Merlin so that no one
would know where he was and she could become a great enchantress
in the realm, as she foolishly thought. And she
planned very cleverly so as to find out the wise old man's
secret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>She wanted him to think that she loved him dearly. At first
she played about him with lively, pretty talk, vivid smiles, and
he watched and laughed at her as
if she were a playful kitten. Then
as she saw that he half disdained
her she began to put on very
grave and serious fits, turned red
and pale when he came near her,
or sighed or gazed at him, so
silently and with such sweet devotion
that he half believed that
she really loved him truly.</p>

<span class="caption">HE LAUGHED AT HER.</span>
</div>

<p>But after a while a great melancholy
fell over Merlin, he felt
so terribly sad that he passed
away out of the kings' court and
went down to the beach. There
he found a little boat and stepped
into it. Vivien had followed him
without his knowing it. She sat down in the boat and while
he took the sail she seized the helm of the boat. They were
driven across the sea with a strong wind and came to the
shores of Brittany. Here Merlin got out and Vivien followed
him all the way into the wild woods of Broceliande. Every
step of the way Merlin was perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>They sat down together, she lay beside him and kissed his
feet as if in the deepest reverence and love. A twist of gold was
wound round her hair, a priceless robe of satiny samite clung
about her beautiful limbs. As she kissed his feet she cried:</p>

<p>"Trample me down, dear feet which I have followed all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
through the world and I will worship you. Tread me down
and I will kiss you for it."</p>

<p>But Merlin still said not a word.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">MERLIN FELT SO TERRIBLY SAD.</span>
</div>

<p>"Merlin do you love me?" at last cried Vivien, with her face
sadly appealing to him. And again, "O, Merlin, do you love
me?" "Great Master, do you love me?" she cried for the third
time.</p>

<p>And then when he was as quiet as ever she writhed up toward
him, slid upon his knee, twined her feet about his ankles,
curved her arms about his neck and used one of her hands as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
white comb to run through his long ashy beard which she
drew all across her neck down to her knees.</p>

<p>"See! I'm clothing myself with wisdom," she cried. "I'm a
golden summer butterfly that's been caught in a great old
tyrant spider's web that's going to eat me up in this big wild
wood without a word to me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Vivien, with these pretty tricks of
yours?" cried Merlin at last. "What do you want me to give
you?"</p>

<p>"What!" said Vivien, smiling saucily, "have you found your
tongue at last? Now yesterday you didn't open your lips once
except to drink. And then I, with my own lady hands, made
a pretty cup and offered you your water kneeling before you
and you drank it, but gave me not a word of thanks. And
when we stopped at the other spring when you lay with your
feet all golden with blossoms from the meadows we passed
through you know that I bathed your feet before I bathed my
own. But yet no thanks from you. And all through this wild
wood, all through this morning when I fondled you, still not a
word of thanks."</p>

<p>Then Merlin locked her hand in his and said, "Vivien, have
you never seen a wave as it was coming up the beach ready to
break? Well, I've been seeing a wave that was ready to break
on me. It seemed to me that some dark, tremendous wave
was going to come and sweep me away from my hold on the
world, away from my fame and my usefulness and my great
name. That's why I came away from Arthur's court to make
me forget it and feel better. And when I saw you coming after
me it seemed to me that you were that wave that was going to
roll all over me. But pardon me, now, child, your pretty ways
have brightened everything again, and now tell me what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
would like to have from me. For I owe you something three
times over, once for neglecting you, twice for the thanks for
your goodness to me, and lastly for those dainty gambols of
yours. So tell me now, what will you have?"</p>

<p>Vivien smiled mournfully as she answered:</p>

<p>"I've always been afraid that you were not really mine, that
you didn't love me truly, that you didn't quite trust me, and
now you yourself have owned it. Don't you see, dear love,
how this strange mood of yours must make me feel it more than
ever? must make me yearn still more to prove that you are mine,
must make me wish still more to know that great charm of
waving hands and woven footsteps that you told me about,
just as a proof that you trust me? If you told that to me I
should know that you are mine, and I should have the great
proof of your love, because I think that however wise you may
be you do not know me yet."</p>

<p>"I never was less wise, you inquisitive Vivien," said Merlin,
"than when I told you about that charm. Why won't you ask
me for another boon?"</p>

<p>Then Vivien, as if she were the tenderest hearted little maid
that ever lived, burst into tears and said:</p>

<p>"No, master, don't be angry at your little girl. Caress me,
let me feel myself forgiven, for I have not the heart to ask for
another boon. I don't suppose that you know the old rhyme,
'Trust not at all or all in all?'"</p>

<p>Then Merlin looked at her and half believed what she said.
Her voice was so tender, her face was so fair, her eyes were so
sweetly gleaming behind her tears.</p>

<p>He locked her hand in his again and said, "If you should
know this charm you might sometimes in a wild moment of
anger or a mood of overstrained affection when you wanted me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
all to yourself or when you were jealous in a sudden fit, you
might work it on me."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Vivien, as if she were angry, "I am not
trusted. Well, hide it away, hide it, and I shall find it out, and
when I've found it beware, look out for Vivien! When you
use me so it's a wonder that I can love you at all, and as for
jealousy, it seems to me this wonderful charm was invented
just to make me jealous. I suppose you have a lot of pretty
girls whom you have caged here and there all over the world
with it."</p>

<p>Then the great master laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Long, long years ago," he said, "there lived a King in the
farthest East of the East. A tawny pirate who had plundered
twenty islands or more anchored his boat in the King's
port, and in the boat was a woman. For, as he had passed one
of the islands the pirates had seen two cities full of men in boats
fighting for a woman on the sea; he had pushed up his black
boat in among the rest, lightly scattered every one of them and
brought her off with half his people killed with arrows. She
was a maiden so smooth, so white, so wonderful that a light
seemed to come from her as she walked. When the pirate came
upon the shore of the Eastern King's island the King asked him
for the woman, but he would not give her up. So the King
imprisoned the pirate and made the woman his queen.</p>

<p>"All the people adored her, the King's councilmen and all
his soldiers, the beasts themselves. The camels knelt down
before her unbidden, and the black slaves of the mountains
rang her golden ankle bells just to see her smile. So little
wonder that the King grew very jealous. He had his horns
blown through all the hundred under-kingdoms which he
ruled, telling the people that he wanted a wizard who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
teach him some charm to work upon the queen and make her
all his own. To the wizard who could do this he promised a
league of mountain land full of golden mines, a province with
a hundred miles of coast, a palace and a princess. But all the
wizards who failed should be killed and their heads would be
hung on the city gates until they mouldered away.</p>

<p>"So there were many, many wizards all through the hundred
kingdoms who tried to work the charm, but failed; many
wizard heads bleached on the walls, and for weeks a troupe
of carrion crows hung like a cloud above the towers of the city
gateways. But at last the king's men found a little glassy
headed, hairless man who lived alone in a great wilderness and
ate nothing but grass. He read only one book, and by always
reading had got grated down, filed away and lean, with monstrous
eyes and his skin clinging to his bones. But since he
never tasted wine or flesh&mdash;the wall that separates people from
spirits became crystal to him. He could see through it, perceive
the spirits as they walked and hear them talking; so
he learned their secrets. Often he drew a cloud of rain
across a sunny sky, or when there was a wild storm and
the pine woods roared he made everything calm again.</p>

<p>"He was the man that was wanted. They dragged him to
the king's court by force, he didn't want to go. There he
taught the king how to charm the queen so that no one could
see her again, and she could see no one except the king as he
passed about the palace. She lay as if quite dead and lost to
life. But when the king offered the magician his league of
golden mines, the province with a hundred miles of sea coast,
the palace and the princess, the old man turned away, went
back to his wilderness and lived on grass and vanished away.
But his book came down to me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have the book!" cried Vivian smiling saucily. "The
charm is written in it. Good, take my advice and let me know
the secret at once, for if you should hide it away like a puzzle in
a chest, if you should put chest upon chest, and lock and padlock
each chest thirty times and bury them all away under
some vast mound like the heaps of soldiers on the battle-field,
still I should hit upon some way of digging it out, of picking it,
of opening it and reading the charm. And <i>then</i> if I tried it on
you who would blame me?"</p>

<p>"You read the book, my pretty Vivien?" cried Merlin.
"Well, it's only twenty pages long, but such pages! Every
page has a square of text that looks like a blot, the letters no
longer than fleas' legs written in a language that has long gone
by, and all the borders and margins scribbled, crossed and
crammed with notes. You read that book! No one, not
even I can read the text, and no one besides me can make out
the notes on the margins. I found the charm in the margin.
Oh, it is simple enough. Any child might work it and then
not be able to undo it. Don't ask me again for it, because
even although you would love me too much to try it on me,
still you might try it on some of the knights of the Round
Table."</p>

<p>"O, you are crueller than any man ever told of in a story, or
sung about in song!" cried Vivien. She clapped her hands
together and wailed out a shriek. "I'm stabbed to the heart! I
only wished that prove to you that were wholly mine, that you
loved me and now I'm killed with a word. There's nothing
left for me to do except crawl into some hole or cave, and if the
wolves won't tear me to pieces, just to weep my life away,
killed with unutterable unkindness!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>She paused, turned away, hung her head while the hair
uncoiled itself. Then she wept afresh.</p>

<p>The dark wood grew darker with a storm coming over the sky.</p>

<p>Merlin sat thinking quietly and half believed that she was true.</p>

<p>"Come out of the storm," he called over to her, "come here
into the hollow old oak tree."</p>

<p>Then since she didn't answer, he tried three times to calm
her but quite in vain. At last, however, she let herself be
conquered, came back to her old perch, and nestled there,
half falling from his knees. Gentle Merlin saw the slow tears
still standing in her eyes and threw his arms kindly about her.
But Vivien unlinked herself at once, rose with her arms crossed
upon her bosom and fled away.</p>

<p>"No more love between us two," she cried, "for you do not
trust me. Oh, it would have been better if I had died three
times over than to have asked you once! Farewell, think
gently of me and I will go. But before I leave you let me
swear once more that if I've been planning against you in all
this, may the dark heavens send one great flash from out the
sky to burn me to a cinder!"</p>

<p>Just as she ended a bolt of lightning darted across the sky,
and sliced the giant oak tree into a thousand splinters and
spikes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Merlin, save me! save me!" cried Vivien, terrified lest
the heavens had heard her oath and were going to kill her.
And she flew back to his arms. She called him her dear
protector, her lord and liege, her seer, her bard, her silver
star of evening, her God, her Merlin, the one passionate love
of her life, and hugged him close.</p>

<p>All the time overhead the tempest bellowed, the branches
snapped above them in the rushing rain. Her glittering eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and neck seemed to come and go before Merlin's eyes with the
lightning. At last the storm had spent its passion, the woodland
was all in peace again, and Merlin, overtalked and overworn
had told all of the charm and had fallen asleep.</p>

<span class="caption">IN THE HOLLOW OF THE OLD OAK TREE LEFT HIM LYING DEAD.</span>

<p>Then in a moment Vivien worked the charm with woven
footsteps and waving arms, and in the hollow of the old oak
tree left him lying dead to all life, use and fame and name.</p>

<p>"I have made his glory mine! O fool!" she shrieked, and
she sprang down through the great forest, the thicket closed
about her behind her and all the woods echoed, "Fool!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="BALIN_AND_BALAN" id="BALIN_AND_BALAN"></a>BALIN AND BALAN.</h2>

<p>King Pellam owed Arthur some tribute money so Arthur
told three of his knights to go see about it and collect it for
him.</p>

<p>"Very well," said one of the knights, "but listen, on the way
to King Pellam's country, near Camelot, there are two strange
knights sitting beside a fountain. They challenge and overthrow
every knight that passes. Shall I stop to fight them as
we go by and send them back to you?"</p>

<p>Arthur laughed, "No, don't stop for anything; let them
wait until they can find some one stronger themselves."</p>

<p>With that the three men left. But after they had gone
Arthur, who loved a good fight himself, started away early one
morning for the fountain side of Camelot. On its right hand
he saw the knight Balin sitting under an alder tree, with his
horse beside him, and on the left hand under a poplar tree
with his horse at his side sat the knight Balan.</p>

<p>"Fair sirs," cried Arthur, "why are you sitting here?"</p>

<p>"For the sake of glory," they answered. "We're stronger
than all Arthur's court. We've proved that because we easily
overthrow every knight that comes by here."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm of Arthur's court, too," replied the king, "although
I've never done so much in jousts as in real wars. But
see whether you can overthrow me so easily too."</p>

<p>So the two brothers came out boldly and fought with Arthur,
but he struck them both lightly down, then softly came away
and nobody knew anything about it.</p>

<p>But that evening while Balin and Balan sat very meekly
by the bubbling water a spangled messenger came riding by
and cried out to them: "Sirs, you are sent for by the King."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>So they followed the man back to the court. "Tell me your
names," demanded Arthur, "and why do you sit there by the
fountain?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus095.jpg" width="400" height="357" alt="TWO STRANGE KNIGHTS." title="TWO STRANGE KNIGHTS." />
<span class="caption">TWO STRANGE KNIGHTS.</span>
</div>

<p>"My name is Balin," answered one of the men, "and my
brother's name is Balan. Three years ago I struck down one
of your slaves whom I heard had spoken ill of me, and you
sent me away for a three years' exile. Then I thought that
if we would sit by the well and would overcome every knight
who passed by you would be a more willing to take me back.
But today some man of yours came along and conquered us
both. What do you wish with me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be wiser for falling," Arthur said. "Your chair is in the
hall vacant. Take it again and be my knight once more."</p>

<p>So Balin went back into the old hall of the Knights of the
Round Table, and they all clashed their cups together drinking
his welcome, and sang until all of Arthur's banners of war
hanging overhead began to stir as they always did on the
battlefield.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men who had gone to collect the taxes from
King Pellam returned.</p>

<p>"Sir King," they cried to Arthur, "We scarcely could see
Pellam for the gloom in his hall. That man who used to be
one of your roughest and most riotous enemies is now living like
a monk in his castle and has all sorts of holy things about him,
and says he has given up all matters of the world. He wouldn't
even talk about the tribute money and told us that his heir
Sir Garlon, attended to his business for him, so we went to
Garlon and after a struggle we got it. Then we came away, but
as we passed through the deep woods we found one of your
knights lying dead, killed by a spear. After we had buried
him, we talked with an old woodman who told us that there's a
demon of the woods who had probably slain the knight. This
demon, he said, was once a man who lived all alone and learned
black magic. He hated people so much that when he died he
became a fiend. The woodman showed us the cave where he
has seen the demon go in and out and where he lives. We
saw the print of a horse's hoof, but no more."</p>

<p>"Foully and villainously slain!" cried Arthur thinking of
his poor killed knight in the woods. "Who will go hunt this
demon of the woods for me?"</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed Balan, ready to dart instantly away, but
first he embraced Balin, saying, "Good brother, hear; don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
let your angry passions conquer you, fight them away. Remember
how these knights of the Round Table welcomed you
back. Be a loving brother with them and don't imagine that
there is hatred among them here any more than there is in
heaven itself."</p>

<p>When bad Balan left, Balin set himself to learn how to curb
his wildness and become a courteous and manly knight. He
always hovered about Lancelot, the pattern knight
of all the court, to see how he did, and when he noticed
Lancelot's sweet smiles and his little pleasant words that
gladdened every knight or churl or child that he passed, Balin
sighed like some lame boy who longed to scale a mountain top
and could scarcely limp up one hundred feet from the base.</p>

<p>"It's Lancelot's worship of the queen that helps to make him
gentle," said he to himself. "If I want to be gentle I must
serve and worship lovely Queen Guinevere too. Suppose I ask
the King to let me have some token of hers on my shield instead
of these pictures of wild beasts with big teeth and grins. Then
whenever I see it I'll forget my wild heats and violences."</p>

<p>"What would you like to bear on your shield?" asked the
king when Balin spoke to him about his wish.</p>

<p>"The queen's own crown-royal," replied Balin.</p>

<p>Then the queen smiled and turned to Arthur. "The crown
is only the shadow of the king," she said, "and this crown
is the shadow of that shadow. But let him have it if it will
help him out of his violences."</p>

<p>"It's no shadow to me, my queen," cried Balan, "no shadow
to me, king. It's a light for me."</p>

<p>So Balin was given the crown to bear on his shield and whenever
he looked at it, it seemed to make him feel gentle and
patient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>But one morning as he heard Lancelot and the queen talking
together on the white walk of lilies that led to Queen Guinevere's
bower, all his old passions seemed to come back and filled him
and he darted madly away on his horse, not stopping until
he had passed the fount where he had sat with his brother
Balan and had dived into the skyless woods beyond. There
the gray-headed woodman was hewing away wearily at a
branch of a tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus098.jpg" width="400" height="536" alt="BALIN WAS GIVEN THE CROWN TO WEAR ON HIS SHIELD."

<span class="caption">BALIN WAS GIVEN THE CROWN TO WEAR ON HIS SHIELD.</span>
</div><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give me your axe, Churl," cried Balin, and with one sharp
cut he struck it down.</p>

<p>"Lord!" cried the woodman, "you could kill the devil of
this woods if any one can. Just yesterday I saw a flash of him.
Some people say that our Sir Garlon has learned black magic
too and can ride armed unseen. Just look into the demon's
cave."</p>

<p>But Balin said the woodman was foolish, and rode off through
the glades with a drooping head. He did not notice that on
his right a great cavern chasm yawned out of the darkness.
Once he heard the mosses beneath him thud and tremble and
then the shadow of a spear shot from behind him and ran along
the ground. The light of somebody's armor flashed by him
and vanished into the woods.</p>

<p>Balin dashed after this but he was so blinded by his rage that
he stumbled against a tree, breaking his lance and falling from
his horse. He sprang to his feet and darted off again not knowing
where he was going until the massy battlements of King
Pellam's castle appeared.</p>

<p>"Why do you wear the crown royal on your shield?" Pellam's
men asked him as soon as they saw him.</p>

<p>"The fairest and best of ladies living gave it to me," Balin
replied, as he stalled his horse and strode across the court to the
banquet hall.</p>

<p>"Why do you wear the royal crown?" Sir Garlon asked him
as they sat at table.</p>

<p>"The queen whom Lancelot and we all worship as the fairest,
best and purest gave it to me to wear," said Balin.</p>

<p>But Sir Garlon only hissed at him and made fun of what he
said, and Balin reached for a wonderful goblet embossed with
a sacred picture to hurl it at Garlon, but the thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
gentle queen about whom he was talking soothed his temper.
The next morning, however, in the court Sir Garlon mocked
him again and Balin's face grew black with anger. He tore
out his sword from its shield and crying out fiercely, "Ha!
I'll make a ghost of you!" struck Garlon hard on the helmet.</p>

<p>The blade flew and splintered into six parts which clinked
upon the stones below while Garlon reeled slowly backward
and fell. Balin dragged him by the banneret of his helmet
and struck again, but in a minute twenty warriors with
pointed lances were making for him from the castle. Balin
dashed his fist against the foremost face then dipped through
a low doorway out along a glimmering gallery until he saw
the open portals of King Pellam's chapel. He slipped inside
this and crept behind the door while the others howled past
outside.</p>

<p>Before the golden altar he noticed lying the brightest
lance he had ever seen with its point painted red with blood.
Seizing it he pushed it out through an open casement, leaned
on it and leaped in a half-circle to the ground outside. Running
along a path he found his horse, mounted him and
scudded away. An arrow whizzed to his right, another to
his left and a third over his head while he heard Pellam crying
out feebly, "Catch him, catch him! he mustn't pollute holy
things!"</p>

<p>But Balin quickly dove beneath the tree boughs and raced
through miles of thick groves and open meadowland until his
good horse, at last wearied and uncertain in his footsteps,
stumbled over a fallen oak and threw Balin headlong.</p>

<p>As Balin rose to his feet he looked at the Queen's crown on
his shield and then drew the shield from off his neck. "I have
shamed you," he cried. "I won't carry you any more," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
he hung it up on a branch and threw himself on the ground in
a passionate sleep.</p>

<p>While he slept there the beautiful wicked Vivien came
riding by through the woodland alleys with her squire, warbling
a song.</p>

<p>"What is this?" she cried as she noticed the shield on the
tree, "a shield with a crown upon it. And there's a horse.
Where's the rider? Oh! there he is sleeping. Hail royal
knight, I'm flying away from a bad king and the knight I was
riding with was hurt, and my poor squire isn't of much use in
helping me. But you, Sir Prince, will surely guide me to the
Warrior King Arthur, the Blameless, to get me some shelter."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'll never go to Arthur's court again," cried Balin.
"I'm not a prince any more, or a knight. I have brought the
Queen's crown to shame."</p>

<p>Then Vivien laughed shrilly, and told Balin a wicked story
about the Queen which she just imagined in her wicked mind.
But she told it so cunningly and smiled so sunnily as she talked
that Balin believed her and he flew into the more passionate
rage because he thought he had been deceived in the Queen
whom he had worshipped.</p>

<p>He ground his teeth together, sprang up with a yell, tore
the shield from the branch and cast it on the ground, drove
his heel <i>into the royal crown</i>, stamped and trampled upon it
until it was all spoiled, then hurled the shield from him out
among the forest weeds and cursed the story, the queen and
Vivien.</p>

<p>His weird yell had thrilled through the woods where Balan
was lurking for his foe. "There! that's the scream of the
wood-devil I'm looking for," he thought. "He has killed
some knight and trampled on his shield to show his loathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of our order and the queen. Devil or man, whichever you
are, take care of your head!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">HE DROVE HIS HEEL INTO THE ROYAL CROWN.</span>
</div>

<p>With that he made swiftly for his poor brother whom he did
not recognize. Sir Balin spoke not a word but snatched the
buckler from Vivien's squire, vaulted on his horse and in a
moment had clashed with his brother's armor. King Pellam's
holy spear reddened with blood as it pricked through
Balan's shield to his flesh. Then Balin's horse, wearied to
death, rolled back over his rider and crushed him inward and
both men fell and swooned away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fools!" cried Vivien to her young squire. "Come, you
Sir Chick, loosen their casques and see who they are. They
must be rivals for the same woman to fight so hard."</p>

<p>"They are happy," her gentle squire answered, "if they
died for love. And Vivien, though you beat me like your dog
I would die for you."</p>

<p>"Don't die, Sir Boy," cried Vivien, "I'd rather have a live
dog than a dead lion. Come away, I don't like to look at
them," and she made her palfrey leap off over the fallen oak
tree.</p>

<p>Balin was the first to wake from his swoon. As soon as he
saw his brother's face he crawled over to his side moaning.
Then Balan faintly opened his eyes and seeing who was with
him kissed Balin's forehead.</p>

<p>"O Balin," he cried, "why didn't you carry your own
shield which I knew, and why did you trample all over this
one which bears the queen's own crown which I know?"</p>

<p>So Balin slowly gasped out the whole story of his shield.
Then they each said good-night to the other and closed their
eyes, locked in each other's arms.</p>

<h2><a name="LANCELOT_AND_ELAINE" id="LANCELOT_AND_ELAINE"></a>LANCELOT AND ELAINE.</h2>


<p>Long before Arthur was crowned king while he was roving
one night over the trackless realms of Lyonesse he came upon
a glen with a gray boulder and a lake. As he rode up the
highway in the misty moonshine he suddenly stepped upon a
white skeleton of a man with a crown of diamonds upon its
skull. The skull broke off from the body and rolled away
into the lake. Arthur alighted, reached down and picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
up the crown and set it on his head murmuring to himself,
"<i>You too shall be king some day</i>," for the skeleton was the
bones of a king who had fought with his brother there and
been killed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">YOU TOO SHALL BE KING SOME DAY.</span>
</div>

<p>When Arthur was crowned he plucked the nine gems out of
the crown he had found on the skeleton and showed them to
his knights with the words:</p>

<p>"These jewels belong to the whole kingdom for everybody's
use and not to the king. Hereafter there is to be joust for
one of them every year and in that way in nine years time
we will learn who is the mightiest in the kingdom and we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
race with each other to become skilful in the use of arms until
at last we shall be able to drive away the heathen horde
from the land."</p>

<p>Eight years had now passed and there had been eight jousts.
Lancelot had won the diamond every year and intended when
he had been victorious in all the jousts, to give the nine gems
to the queen. When the ninth year came Arthur proclaimed
the tournament for the central and largest diamond to be held
at Camelot, where he was holding his court. But the queen
became ill as the time for the tour jousts drew near and he asked
her whether she was too feeble to go to see Lancelot in the
lists.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," replied Guinevere, "and you know it,"
and she looked up languidly to Lancelot who stood near.</p>

<p>Lancelot thinking that she would rather have him near
while she was ill than to receive all the diamonds of the crown,
said:</p>

<p>"Sir King, that old wound of mine is not quite healed so I
can hardly ride in my saddle."</p>

<p>So the king went, excused Lancelot, and rode away alone to
the lists while Lancelot remained, but as soon as Arthur was
gone the <i>queen told Lancelot that he ought by all means go too and
fight</i>.</p>

<p>"But how can I go now," replied Lancelot, "after what I
have said to the king."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what to do," said Guinevere. "Everybody
says that men go down before your spear just because of your
great name. They are afraid as soon as you appear and of
course, they are conquered. Go in today entirely unknown
and win for yourself, then after all is over the king will be
pleased with you for being so clever."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Lancelot quickly got his horse and leaving the beaten
thoroughfare, chose a green path among the downs to take
him to the lists. It was a new road to him however and he
lost his way and did not know where to go until at last he
came upon a faintly traced pathway that led to the castle
of Astolat far away on a hill. He went thither, blew the horn
at the gate where a <i>dumb, wrinkled old man came to let him in</i>.
In the castle court he met the lord of Astolat with his two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
young sons, Sir Torre and Sir Lavaine and behind them the
lily maiden Elaine, Astolat's daughter. They were jesting
and laughing as they came.</p>

</div>

<p>"Where do you come from, my guest, and what is your
name?" asked Astolat. "By your state and presence I
would guess you to be the chief of Arthur's court, for I have
seen him although the other knights of the Round Table are
strangers to me."</p>

<p>Lancelot, Arthur's chief knight replied, "I am of Arthur's
court and I am known, and my shield which I have happened
to bring with me, is known too. But as I am going to joust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
for the diamond at Camelot as a stranger do not ask me my
name. After it is over you shall know me and my shield.
If you have some blank shield around, or one with a strange
device, pray lend it to me."</p>

<p>"Here is Torre's," the Lord of Astolat replied. "He was
hurt in his first tilt and so his shield is blank enough, God
knows. You can have his."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Sir Torre simply, "since I can't use it you
may have it."</p>

<p>His father laughed. "Fie, Churl, is that an answer for a
noble knight? You must pardon him, but Lavaine, my
younger boy, is so full of life he will ride in the lists, joust for
the diamond, win and bring it in one hour to set upon his
sister's golden hair and make her three times as wilful as before."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, good father! don't shame me before this noble
knight. It was all a joke. Elaine dreamed that some one
had put the diamond into her hand and it was so slippery it
dropped into a pool of water. Then I told her that if I fought
and won it for her she must keep it safer than that. But it
was all in fun. However, if you'll give me your leave, I'll
ride to Camelot with this noble knight. I shall not win but
I'll do my best to win."</p>

<p>Lancelot smiled a moment. "If you'll give me the pleasure
of your company over the downs where I lost myself I'll be
glad to have you as a friend and guide. You shall win the
diamond if you can and then give it to your sister if you wish."</p>

<p>"Such diamonds are for queens and not for simple little
girls," said Sir Torre.</p>

<p>Elaine flushed at this and Lancelot said, "If beautiful things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
are for beautiful people this maiden may wear as fine jewels
as there are in the world."</p>

<p>Then the lily maid lifted her eyes and thought that Lancelot
was the greatest man that had ever lived. She loved his
bruised and bronzed face seamed across with an old sword-cut.</p>

<p>They took the pet knight of Arthur's court into the rude
hall of Astolat where they entertained him with their best
meats, wines and minstrel melodies. They told him about
the dumb old man at the gate, how ten years ago he had
warned Astolat of the heathen fighters coming, and how they
had all escaped to the woods and lived in a boatman's hut by
the river while the old man had been caught and had his tongue
cut off.</p>

<p>"Those were dull days," said the Lord of Astolat, "until
Arthur came and drove the heathen away."</p>

<p>"O, great Lord!" cried Lavaine to Lancelot, "you fought
in those glorious wars with Arthur. Tell us about them!"</p>

<p>So Lancelot told him all about the fight all day long at the
white mouth of the river Glenn, the four loud battles on the
shore of Duglas where the glorious king wore on his cuirass an
emerald carved into Our Lady's head. "On the mount of
Badon," he said, "I saw him charge at the head of all of his
Round Table and break the heathen hosts. Afterward he
stood on a heap of the killed, all red, from his spurs to the
plumes of his helmet, with their blood, and he cried to me:
'They are broken! they are broken!' In this heathen war the
fire of God filled him, I never saw anyone like him, there is no
greater leader."</p>

<p>"Except yourself," thought the lily maid Elaine. All
through the night she saw his dark, splendid face living before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
her eyes and early in the morning she arose as if to bid goodbye
to Lavaine, stole step after step down the long tower
stairs and passed out to the court where Lancelot was smoothing
the glossy shoulders of his horse. She drew nearer and
stood in the dewy light,
studying his face as
though it was a god. He
had never dreamed she
was so beautiful.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;FAIR LORD,&quot; SAID ELAINE.
</span>
</div>
<p>"Fair lord," said
Elaine, "I don't know
your name but I believe
it is the noblest himself
of them all. Will you
wear a token of me at the
tournament today?"</p>

<p>"No, pretty lady," said
he, "for I've never worn
a token of any woman in
the lists; as every one who
knows me knows."</p>

<p>"Then by wearing
mine you'll be less likely to be found out this time."</p>

<p>"That's true, my child, well, I'll wear it. Fetch it out to
me. What is it?"</p>

<p>"A red sleeve bordered with pearls," replied Elaine, and
she went in and brought it out to him.</p>

<p>Then he wound it round his helmet and said he had never
before done so much for any girl in the world. The blood
sprang to Elaine's face as he said that, and filled her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
delight, although she grew all the paler as Lavaine came out
and handed Sir Torre's shield to Lancelot. Lancelot gave
his own shield to Elaine saying, "Do me this favor, child, keep
my shield for me until I come back."</p>

<p>"It's a favor to me," she replied smiling, "I'll be your
squire."</p>

<p>"Come, Lily Maid," cried Lavaine, "you'll be a lily maid
in earnest if you don't get to bed and have some sleep," and
he kissed her good-bye.</p>

<p>Lancelot kissed her hand as they moved away. She watched
them at the gateway until their sparkling arms dipped below
the downs, then climbed up to her tower with the shield and
there she studied it and mused over it every day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lancelot and Lavaine passed far over the long
downs until they reached an old hermit who lived in a white
rock. Here they spent the night. The next morning as they
rode away Lancelot said, "Listen to me, but keep what I say
a secret, you're riding with Lancelot of the Lake."</p>

<p>"The great Lancelot?" stammered Lavaine, catching his
breath with surprise. "There is only one other great man to
see, and that is Britain's king of kings, Arthur. And he's
going to be at the tournament, too."</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the lists in the meadows by Camelot,
Lancelot pointed out the king who, as he sat in the peopled
gallery was very easy to recognize because of his five dragons.
A golden dragon clung to his crown, another writhed down
his robe while two others in gilded carved wood-work formed
the arms of his chair. The canopy above him blazed with
the last big diamond.</p>

<p>"You call me great," cried Lancelot, "I'm not great, there's
the man."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Lavaine gaped at Arthur as if he were something miraculous.
Then the trumpets blew. The two sides, those who held the
lists and those who attacked them, set their lances in rest,
then struck their spurs, moved out suddenly and shocked
in the center of the field. The ground shook and there was
a low thunder of arms. Lancelot waited a little until he saw
which was the weaker side, then sprang into the fight with
them. In those days of his glory, whomever he struck he
overthrew, whether they were kings, dukes, earls, counts or
barons. But that day in the field some of his relatives were
holding the lists who did not know him and who could not
bear the idea that any stranger knight should out do the feats
of their own Lancelot.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" one of them asked, "Isn't it Lancelot?"</p>

<p>"When has Lancelot ever worn a lady's token?" the others
replied.</p>

<p>"Who is it then?" they cried, furious to guard the name of
Lancelot. They pricked their steeds and moving all together
bore down upon him like a wild wave that upsets a ship. One
spear lamed Lancelot's charger and another pierced through
Lancelot's side, snapped there and stuck. Lavaine now did
splendidly for he brought a famous old knight down by Lancelot's
side. Lancelot in the meantime rose to his feet in all
his agony and by a sort of miracle as it seemed to those who
were on his side, drove all his opponents back to the barrier.
Then the trumpet blew and proclaimed that the knight who
wore the scarlet sleeve with pearls was victor.</p>

<p>"Go up and get your diamond," his men said to him.</p>

<p>"Don't give me any diamonds," said Lancelot. "My prize
is death, I'll leave and don't follow."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he vanished into the poplar grove where he told
Lavaine to draw out the lance head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll die, if I do," cried Lavaine.</p>

<p>"I'm dying now with it," said Lancelot, so Lavaine drew
it out and Lancelot gave a wonderful shriek and swooned
away.</p>

<p>Then the old hermit came out, carried him into the white
rock and stanched his wound.</p>

<p>Immediately after he had left the field the men of his side
went to the king and said that the knight who had won the day
had left without receiving his prize.</p>

<p>"Such a knight as that must not go uncared for," said
the king. "Gawain, ride out and find him and since he didn't
come for his diamond we will send it to him. Don't leave
your quest until you have him."</p>

<p>Gawain the courteous was a good young knight but he
didn't like it that he had to leave the banquet and the king's
side to look for a stranger knight, so he mounted his horse
rather crossly. He rode all round the country to every
place except the right one, poplar grove, and at last very late
reached the Castle of Astolat.</p>

<p>"What news from Camelot?" cried Elaine as soon as she
saw him, "What about the knight with the red sleeve?"</p>

<p>"He won."</p>

<p>"I knew it," she said.</p>

<p>"But he left the jousts wounded in his side."</p>

<p>Then Elaine almost swooned away. When the Lord of
Astolat came out and heard about Gawain's quest, "Stay
with us, noble prince," said he. "For the knight was here
and left his shield with us, so he will certainly come back or
send for it. Besides my son is with him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Gawain thought he would have a pleasant time with Elaine
so he stayed. But Elaine rebelled against his pretty love-making
and asked him why he neglected the king's quest and
why he didn't ask to see the knight's shield.</p>

<p>"I've lost my quest in the light of your blue eyes," said
Gawain, "but let me see the shield. Ah! the king was
right!" he cried out when Elaine showed it to him. "It
was our Lancelot."</p>

<p>"I was right too," Elaine said merrily, "for I dreamed that
my knight was the greatest of them all."</p>

<p>"And suppose that I dreamed that you love this greatest
knight?" returned Gawain.</p>

<p>"What do I know?" Elaine answered simply. "I don't
know whether I know what love is, but I do know that if I
do not love him there isn't another man whom I can love."</p>

<p>"Yes, you love him well," said Gawain. "And I suppose
you know just where your greatest knight is hidden, so let me
leave my quest with you. If you love him it will be sweet to you
to give him the diamond and if he loves you it will be sweet
to him to receive it from you, while even if he doesn't love you,
a diamond is always a diamond. Farewell a thousand times.
If he loves you I may see you at court after while."</p>

<p>Then Gawain lightly kissed her hand as he laid the diamond
in it, and, wearied of his quest, leaped on his horse and carrolling
a love-ballad airily rode away to the court where it was soon
buzzed abroad that a maid of Astolat loved Lancelot and that
Lancelot loved a maid of Astolat.</p>

<p>The maid meanwhile crept up to her father one day and received
his leave to take the diamond to Sir Lancelot. Sir
Torre went with her to the gates of Camelot where they saw
Lavaine capering about on a horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lavaine!" she cried, "how is it with my lord Sir Lancelot?"
and she told him about the diamond. Then Sir Torre went on
into the city while Lavaine guided Elaine to the hermit's cave.
As she saw her handsome knight on the floor, a sort of skeleton
of himself, she gave a little tender dolorous cry.</p>

<p>"Your prize, the diamond, sent you by the king," said she,
as she put it into his hand and explained how she had received
it from Gawain. Then he kissed her as a father would kiss a
dear little daughter and she went back to the dim, rich city
of Camelot for the night. But the next morning she was back
in the cave, and day after day she came, caring for him more
mildly, tenderly and kindly than any mother could with a
child, until at last the old hermit said she had nursed him back
to life, then all three rode back together one morning
to Astolat where Lancelot asked Elaine to tell him the dearest
wish of her heart so that he could grant it to her. Elaine
turned as pale as a ghost when he first spoke but at last one
day she told him. She said she wanted him to love her, she
wanted to be his wife.</p>

<p>"If I had chosen to wed," Lancelot replied, slowly, "I
would have been married long before this. But now I shall
never marry, sweet Elaine."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Elaine, "it won't matter if I can't be your
wife, if I can only go with you always and go round the world
with you and serve you."</p>

<p>But Lancelot said that would be a poor way for him to
requite the love and kindness her father and brothers had
shown him. "Noble maid," he went on, "this is only the
first flash of love with you. After awhile you will smile at
yourself about it when you find a knight who is fitter for you
to marry and not three times older than you as I am, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
I will give you broad lands and territories even to a half of
my kingdom across the seas and I'll always be ready to fight
for you in your troubles. I'll do this, dear girl, but more I
cannot."</p>

<p>"Of all this I care for nothing," Elaine said growing deathly
pale and falling in a swoon.</p>

<p>That evening Lancelot sent for his shield from the tower
where Elaine sat with it, and as his horse's hoofs clattered off
upon the stone of the highway she looked down from her
tower, but he did not glance back.</p>

<p>After that Elaine dreamed her time sadly away in the tower
and only wished that she could die. She begged her father to
send for the priest to confess her and asked Lavaine to write
a letter for her to Lancelot. Then she arranged it that when
she died the dumb old man at the gate was to take her in the
barge down the river to the king's palace. Eleven days later
this was done. Elaine was dressed like a little sleeping queen
and floated along the stream with her letter in one hand and
a lily in the other.</p>

<p>That day Lancelot was with the queen and as he looked out
of the casement upon the river he saw the barge hung with
rich black samite, the dumb old man and the lily maid of
Astolat gliding up to the palace door.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried everybody streaming round. "A pale
fairy queen come to take Arthur to fairy land?"</p>

<p>Then the king bade meek Sir Percival and pure Sir Galahad
carry her reverently into the hall where the fine Gawain came
and wondered at her and Lancelot came and mused over her,
and the queen came and pitied her. But King Arthur spied
a letter, opened it and read it aloud to all the lords and ladies.
It was Elaine's goodbye to Lancelot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Then Sir Lancelot told them everything about Elaine and
how he had promised to give her his lands and riches when she
should be ready to marry some knight of her own age.
The king said that he should see that she was buried very grandly.
So they had a procession with all the pomp of a queen, with
gorgeous ceremonies, mass and rolling music while all the
Order of the Round Table followed her to the tomb. Then
they laid the shield of Lancelot at her feet and put a lily in her
hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_HOLY_GRAIL" id="THE_HOLY_GRAIL"></a>THE HOLY GRAIL.</h2>


<p>One day a new monk came into the abbey beyond Camelot.
There was something about him different from all the other
monks there. He was so
polished and clever that
old Ambrosious who had
lived in the old monastery
for fifty years and had
never seen a bit of the
world guessed in a minute
that the new brother had
come from King Arthur's
court. And one windy
April morning as Ambrosious
stood under the yew
tree with this gentle monk
he asked him why he
left the Knights of the
Round Table.</p>

<p>Then Sir Percival answered:</p>

<p>"It was the sweet vision
of the Holy Grail."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus118.jpg" width="300" height="409" alt="&quot;THE HOLY GRAIL,&quot; CRIED AMBROSIOUS." title="&quot;THE HOLY GRAIL,&quot; CRIED AMBROSIOUS." />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE HOLY GRAIL,&quot; CRIED AMBROSIOUS.</span>
</div>

<p>"The Holy Grail," cried Ambrosious. "Heaven knows I
don't know much, but what is that, the phantom of a cup that
comes and goes?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Percival, "what phantom do you mean? It's
the cup that our Lord drank from at his sad last supper, and
after he died Joseph of Aramathea brought it to Glastonbury at
Christmas time, and there it stayed a while and every one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
looked at it or touched it was healed of their sicknesses.
But the times grew so wicked that the cup was caught up into
heaven where nobody could see it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember reading in our old books," said Ambrosious,
"how Joseph built a lonely little church at Glastonbury
on the marsh, but that was long ago. Who first saw the vision
of the Holy Grail to-day?"</p>

<p>"A woman," said Sir Percival, "a nun, my sister who was a
holy maid if ever there was one. The old man to whom she
used to tell her sins (or what she called her sins), often spoke
to her about the legend of the Holy Grail which had been
handed down through six people, each of them a hundred years
old, from the Lord's time. And when Arthur made the order
of the Round Table and all hearts became clean and pure for a
time this old man thought surely the Holy Grail would come
back again. 'O Christ!' he used to say to my sister, 'if only
it would come back and help all the world of its wickedness!'
And then my sister asked him whether it might come to her
by prayer and fasting.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps,' said the father, 'for your heart is as pure as snow.'</p>

<p>"So she prayed and fasted until the sun shone and the wind
blew through her and one day she sent for me. Her eyes were
so beautiful with the light of holiness that I did not know them.</p>

<p>"'Sweet Brother,' she said, 'I have seen the Holy Grail.
I heard a sound like a silver horn but sweeter than any music
we can make, and then a cold silver beam of light streamed in
through my cell, and down the beam stole the Holy Grail,
rose red and throbbing as if it were alive. All the walls of
my cell grew rosy red with quivering rosy colors. Then the
music faded away, the Holy Grail vanished and the colors died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
out in the darkness. So now we know the Holy Thing is here
again, Brother fast, too, and pray, and tell your brother-knights
about it, then perhaps the vision may be seen by you
all, and the whole world will be healed.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus120.jpg" width="300" height="401" alt="MY KNIGHT OF HEAVEN, GO FORTH." title="MY KNIGHT OF HEAVEN, GO FORTH." />
<span class="caption">MY KNIGHT OF HEAVEN, GO FORTH.</span>
</div>

<p>"So I told all the knights and we fasted and prayed for many
weeks. Then my sister cut off all her long streaming silken
hair which used to fall to her feet and out of it braided a strong
sword belt and with silver and crimson thread she wove into it
a crimson grail in a silver beam. Then she bound it on our
beautiful boy knight, Sir Galahad, and said:</p>

<p>"'My knight of heaven, go forth, for you shall see what I have
seen and far in the spiritual city you will be crowned king.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Then she sent the deathless passion of her eyes through him
and he believed what she said.</p>

<p>"Then came a year of miracles. In our great hall there stood
a chair which Merlin had fashioned carved with strange figures
like a serpent and in and out among the strange figures ran a
scroll of strange letters in a language nobody knew like a serpent.
Merlin called it the Seat Perilous, because he said if any one
sat in it he would get lost. And Galahad said that if he got
lost in it he would save himself. So one summer night Sir
Galahad sat down in the chair and all at once there was a
cracking of the roofs above us, and a blast and thunder, and in
the thunder there was a cry and in the blast there was a beam
of light seven times clearer than the daylight. Down the
beam stole the Holy Grail all covered over with a luminous
cloud. Then it passed away but every knight saw his brother
knight's faces in a glory and we all rose and stared at each other
until at last I found my voice and swore a vow.</p>

<p>"I swore that because I had not seen the Holy Grail behind
the cloud I would ride away a year and a day in quest of it until
I could see it as my sister saw it. Galahad swore too, and good
Sir Bors, and Lancelot and many others, knights, and Gawain
louder than all the rest.</p>

<p>"The king was not in the hall that day for he had gone out
to help some poor maiden, but as he came back over the plains
beyond Camelot he saw the roofs rolling in smoke and thought
that his wonderfully dear, beautiful hall which Merlin had
built for him so wonderfully was afire. So he rode fast and
rushed into the tumult of knights and asked me what it all
meant.</p>

<p>"'Woe is me!' cried the king when I told him. 'Had I
been here you would not have sworn the vows.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"'My king,' I answered boldly, had you been here you would
have sworn the vows yourself.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, yes,' said he, 'are you so bold when you didn't see the
Grail? You didn't see farther than the cloud, and what can you
expect to see now if you go out into the wilderness?'</p>

<p>"'No, no, Lord, I didn't see the Grail, I heard the sound, I
saw the light and since I didn't see the holy thing I swore the
vow that I would follow it until I did see.'</p>

<p>"'Then he asked us, knight by knight, whether we had seen
it and each one said, 'No, no, Lord, that was why we swore our
vows,' but suddenly Galahad called out, 'But I saw the
Holy Grail, Sir Arthur, and heard the cry, "O Galahad, follow
me."'</p>

<p>"Ah, Galahad, Galahad,' said the king, 'the vision is for
such as you and for your holy nun but not for these. Are
you all Galahads or all Percivals? No, no, you are just men
with the strength to right the wrongs and violences of the
land. But now since one has seen, all the blind want to see.
However, since you have made the vow, go. But oh, how
often the distressed people of the kingdom will come into the
hall for you to help them and all your chairs will be vacant
while you are out chasing a fire in the quagmire! Many of
you, yes, most of you will never come back again! But come
to-morrow before you go, let us have one more day of field sports
so that before you go I can rejoice in the unbroken strength
of the Order I have made.'</p>

<p>"So the next day there was the greatest tournament that
Camelot had ever seen, and Galahad and I, with a strength
which we had received from the vision, overthrew so many
knights that all the people cheered hotly for Sir Galahad and
Sir Percival. The next morning all the rich balconies along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the streets of Camelot were laden with ladies and showers
of flowers fell over us as we passed out and men and boys
astride lions and dragons, griffins and swans at the street
corners, called us all by name and cried, 'God Speed!' while
many lords and ladies wept. Then we came down to the gate
of The Three Queens and there each one went on his own way.</p>

<p>"I was feeling glad over my victories in the lists and thought
the sky never looked so blue nor the earth so green. All my
blood danced within me for I knew that I would see the Holy
Grail. But after a while I thought of the dark warning of
the king. I looked about and saw that I was quite alone in a
sandy thorny place, and I thought I would die of thirst. Then
I came to a deep lawn with a flowing brook and apple trees
overhanging it. But while I was drinking of the water and
eating of the apples they all turned to dust, and I was alone and
thirsty again in among the sands and thorns. Next I saw
a woman spinning beside a beautiful house. She rose to greet
me and stretched out her arms to welcome me into her house
to rest, but as soon as I touched her she fell to dust, and the
house turned into a shed with a dead baby inside, and then it
fell to dust too.</p>

<p>"Then I rode on and found a big hill and on the top was
a walled city, the spires with incredible pinnacles reaching up
to the sky, and at the gateway there was a crowd of people
who cried out to me:</p>

<p>"Welcome, Percival, you mightiest and purest of men!"</p>

<p>"But when I reached the top there was no one there. I
passed through to the ruined old city and found only one person
a very, very old man. 'Where is the crowd who called out
to me?' I asked him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"He could scarcely speak, but he gasped out, 'Where are
you from and who are you?' and then fell to dust.</p>

<span class="caption">NEXT I SAW A WOMAN SPINNING.</span>
</div>

<p>"Then I was so unhappy I cried. I felt as though even if I
should see the Holy Grail itself and touched it it would crumble
into dust. From there I passed down into a deep valley, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
low down as the city was high up, where I found a chapel with
a hermit in a hermitage near by. I told him about all these
phantoms.</p>

<p>"'You haven't true humility,' he said, 'which is the mother
of all virtue. You haven't lost yourself to find yourself as
Galahad did.'</p>

<p>"Just as he ended suddenly Sir Galahad shone before us in
silver armor. He laid his lance beside the chapel door and
we all went in and knelt in prayer. Then my thirst was
quenched. But when the mass was burned I saw only the holy
elements while Galahad saw the Holy Grail come down upon
the shrine.</p>

<p>"'The Holy Grail,' he said, 'has always been at my side ever
since we came away, fainter in the daytime, but blood-red at
night. In its strength I have overcome evil customs wherever
I have gone, and have passed through Pagan lands and clashed
with Pagan hordes and broken them down everywhere. But
the time is very near now when I shall go into the spiritual
city far away where some one will crown me king. Come with
me for you will see the Holy Grail in a vision when I go.'</p>

<p>"At the close of the day I started away with him. We came
to a hill which only a man could climb, scarred all over with
a hundred frozen streams, and when we reached the top there
was a wild storm. Galahad's armor flashed and darkened again
every instant with quick, thick lightnings which struck the
dead old tree trunks on every side until at last they blazed into
a fire. At the base was a great black swamp partly whitened
with bones of dead men. A chain of bridges lead across it to
the great sea, and Galahad crossed them, one after the other,
but each one burned away as soon as he had passed over so that
I had to stay behind. When he reached the great sea the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Grail hung over his head in a brilliant cloud. Then a boat came
swiftly by and when the sky brightened again with the lightning
I could see him floating away, either in a boat with full sails
or a winged creature which was flying, I couldn't tell which.
Above him hung the Holy Grail rosy red without the cloud.
I had seen the holy thing at last. When I saw Sir Galahad
again he looked like a silver star in the sky, and beyond the
star was the spiritual city with all her spires and gateways in a
glory like one pearl, no larger than a pearl. From the star a
rosy red sparkle from the Grail shot across to the city. But
while I looked a flood of rain came down in torrents, and
how I ever came away I don't know, but anyway at the dawn
of the next day I had reached the little chapel again. There
I got my horse from the hermit and rode back to the gates of
Camelot.</p>

<p>"Just once I met one of the other knights. That was one
night when the full moon was rising and the pelican of Sir
Bors' casque made a shadow on it. I spurred on my horse,
hailed him and we were both very glad to see each other.</p>

<p>"'Where is Sir Lancelot,' he asked. 'Have you seen him?
Once he dashed across me very madly, maddening his horse.
When I asked him why he rode so hotly on a holy quest he
shouted, 'Don't keep me, I was a sluggard, and now I'm going
fast for there's a lion in the way.' Then he vanished.
When I saw how mad he was I felt very sad for I love him,
and I cared no more whether I saw the Holy Grail, or not;
but I rode on until I came to the loneliest parts of the country
where some magicians told me I followed a mocking fire.
This vexed me and when the people saw that I quarrelled with
their priests they bound me and put me into a cell of stones.
I lay there for hours until one night a miracle happened. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of the stones slipped away without any one touching it or
any wind blowing. Through the gap it made I saw the
seven clear stars which we have always called the stars of the
Round Table and across the seven stars the sweet Grail glided
past. Close after a clap of thunder pealed. Then a maiden
came to me in secret and loosed me and let me go.'</p>

</div><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir Bors and I rode along together and when we reached
the city our horses stumbled over heaps of ruined bits of
houses that fell as they trod along the streets. At last brought
us to Arthur's hall.</p>

<p>"As we came in we saw Arthur sitting on his throne with
just a tenth of the knights who had gone out on the quest
of the Holy Grail standing before him, wasted and worn, also
the knights who had stayed at home. When he saw me he
rose and said he was glad to see me back, that he had been
worrying about me because of the fierce gale that had made
havoc through the town and shaken even the new strong hall
and half wrenched the statue Merlin made for him.</p>

<p>"'But the quest,' the king went on, 'have you seen the cup
that Joseph brought long ago to Glastonbury?'</p>

<p>"Then when I told him all that you have been hearing just
now and how I was going to give up the tournament and tilt
and pass into the quiet of the life of the monk, he answered
not a word, but turning quickly to Gawain asked,</p>

<p>"'Gawain, was this quest for you?'</p>

<p>"'No, Lord,' replied Gawain, 'not for such as I. I talked
with a saintly old man about that and he made me very sure
that it wasn't for me. I was very tired of it. But I found a
silk pavilion in the field with a lot of merry girls in it, then this
gale tore it off from the tenting pin and blew my merry maidens
all about with a great deal of discomfort. If it hadn't been
for that storm my twelve months and a day would have passed
very pleasantly for me.'</p>

<p>"Then Arthur turned to Sir Bors, who had pushed across
the throng at once to Lancelot's side, caught him by the hand
and held it there half hidden beside him until the king spied
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Hail, Bors, if ever a true and loyal man could see the Grail
you have seen it,' cried Arthur.</p>

<p>"'Don't ask me about it,' replied Sir Bors with tears in his
eyes 'I may not speak about it; I saw it.'</p>

<p>"The others spoke only about the perils of their storm, and
then it was Lancelot's turn. Perhaps Arthur kept his best
for the last.</p>

<p>"'My Lancelot,' said the king, 'our Strongest, has the
quest availed for you?'</p>

<p>"'Our strongest, O King!' groaned Lancelot and as he
paused I thought I saw a dying fire of madness in his eyes.
'O King, my friend, a sin lived in me that was so strange that
everything pure, noble and knightly in me twined and clung
around it until the good and the poisonous in me grew together,
and when your knights swore to make the quest I
swore only in the hope that could I see or touch the Holy
Grail they might be pulled apart. Then I spoke to a holy
saint who said that if they could not be plucked apart my
quest would be all in vain. So I vowed to him that I would
do just as he told me, and while I was out trying to tear them
away from each other my old madness came back to me and
whipped me off into waste fields far away.</p>

<p>"There I was beaten down by little knights whom at one
time I would have frightened away just by the shadow of my
spear. From there I rode over to the sea-shore where such
a blast of wind began to blow that you could not hear the
waves even although they were heaped up in mountains and
drove the sea like a cataract, while the sand on the beach
swept by like a river. A boat, half-swallowed by the seafoam,
was moored to the shore by a chain. I said to myself that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
would embark in the boat and lose myself and wash away my
sin in the great sea.</p>

<p>"For seven days I rode around over the dreary water and on
the seventh night I felt the boat striking ground. In front of
me rose the enchanted towers of Carbonek, a castle like a rock
upon a rock, with portals open to the sea and steps that met
the waves. A lion sat on each side of them. I went up the
steps and drew my sword. Suddenly flaring their manes the
lions stood up like men and gripped me on my shoulders.
When I was about to strike them a voice said to me, 'Don't
be afraid, or the beasts will tear you to pieces; go on.' Then
my sword was dashed violently from my hand and fell. Up
into the sounding hall I passed but saw not a bench, table,
picture, shield or anything else except the moon over the sea
through the oriel window, but I heard a sweet voice as clear
as a lark singing in the topmost tower to the east. I climbed
up a thousand steps with great pain. It seemed as though I
was climbing forever but at last I reached a door with light
shining through the crannies and I heard voices singing 'Glory
and joy and honor to our Lord and the Holy Vessel, the
Grail.'</p>

<p>"'Then I madly tried the door, it gave way and through
a stormy glare of heat that burned me and made me swoon
away I thought I saw the Grail, all veiled with crimson samite
and around it great angels, awful shapes and wings and eyes!'</p>

<p>"The long hall was silent after Lancelot was done, until airy
Gawain began with a sudden.</p>

<p>"'O King, my liege, my good friend Percival and your
holy nun have driven men mad. By my eyes and ears I swear
I'll be deeper than a blue-eyed cat and three times as blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
as any owl at noon-time hereafter to any holy virgins in their
ecstasies.'</p>

<p>"'Gawain,' replied the king, 'don't try to become blinder;
you're too blind now to want to see. If a sign really came
from heaven Bors, Lancelot and Percival are blessed for they
have each seen according to their sight.'"</p>

<h2><a name="PELLEAS_AND_ETTARRE" id="PELLEAS_AND_ETTARRE"></a>PELLEAS AND ETTARRE.</h2>


<p>When his knights went after the Holy Grail Arthur made
many new knights to fill the gaps made by their absence.
As he sat in his hall one day at old Caerleon the high doors
were softly parted and through these in came a youth, and
with him the outer sunshine and the sweet scent of meadows.</p>

<p>"Make me your knight, Sir King!" he cried, "because I
know all about everything that belongs to a knight and because
I love a maiden."</p>

<p>This youth was Sir Pelleas-of-the-Isles who had heard that
the king had proclaimed a great tournament at Caerleon with
a sword for the victor and a golden crown for the victor's
sweetheart as the prize. He longed to win them, the circlet
for his lady love, the sword for himself.</p>

<p>Just a few days before, while riding across the Forest of
Dean to find the king's palace hall at Caerleon, Pelleas had
felt the sun beating on his helmet so sharply that he reeled
and almost fell from his horse. Then, seeing a hillock near-by
overgrown with stately beech trees and flowers here and
there beneath, he tied his horse to a tree, threw himself down
and was very soon lost in sweet dreams about a maiden, not
any particular maiden for he had no sweetheart at that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>.</p>

<p>But suddenly he was wakened with a sound of chatter and
laughing at the outskirts of the grove, and glancing through
fern he saw a party of young girls in many colors like the
clouds at sunset, all of them riding on richly dressed horses.
They were all talking together in a hodgepodge, some pointing
this way, some that, for they had lost their way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus132.jpg" width="400" height="471" alt="WAS VERY SOON LOST IN SWEET DREAMS ABOUT A MAIDEN."
title="WAS VERY SOON LOST IN SWEET DREAMS ABOUT A MAIDEN." />
<span class="caption">WAS VERY SOON LOST IN SWEET DREAMS ABOUT A MAIDEN.</span>
</div>

<p>Pelleas sprang up, loosed his horse and led him into the
light.</p>

<p>"Just in time!" cried the lady who seemed to be the leader
of the party. "See, our pilot-star! Youth, we are wandering
damsels riding armed, as you see, ready to tilt against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
knights at Caerleon, but we've lost our way. To the right?
to the left? straight on? forward? backward? which is it? tell
us quickly."</p>

<p>Pelleas gazed at her and wondered to himself whether the
famous Queen Guinevere herself was as beautiful as this
maiden. For her violet eyes, scornful eyes, were large and
the bloom on her cheeks was like the rosy dawn. Her beauty
made Pelleas timid and when she spoke to him he could
not answer but only stammered, for he had come from far
away waste islands where besides his sisters, he had scarcely
known any women but the tough wives of the islands who
made fish nets.</p>

<p>With a slow smile the lady turned round to her companions
the smile spreading to them all. For she was Ettarre, a
very great lady in her land.</p>

<p>"O, wild man of the woods," she cried, "don't you understand
our language, or has heaven given you a beautiful face
and no tongue?"</p>

<p>"Lady," he answered, "I just woke from my dreams, and
coming out of the gloomy woods I was dazzled by the sudden
light, and beg your pardon. But are you going to Caerleon?
I'm going too. Shall I lead you to the king?"</p>

<p>"Lead," said she.</p>

<p>So through the woods they went together but his tender
manner, his awe of her and his bashfulness bothered her. "I've
lighted on a fool," she muttered to herself, "so raw and yet
so stale!"</p>

<p>But since she wished to be crowned the Queen of Beauty
in the king's tournament, and since Pelleas looked strong
she thought perhaps he would fight for her, so she flattered
him and was very pleasant and kind. Her three knights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
maidens were kind to him too, for she was a very great lady
and they had to do as she did. When they reached Caerleon
before she passed on to her lodgings she took Pelleas by the
hand and said:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus134.jpg" width="300" height="380" alt="SHE TOOK PELLEAS BY THE HAND." title="SHE TOOK PELLEAS BY THE HAND." />
<span class="caption">SHE TOOK PELLEAS BY THE HAND.</span>
</div>

<p>"O, how strong your hand is! See; look at my poor little
weak one! Will you fight for me and win me the crown, Pelleas,
so that I may love you?"</p>

<p>Pelleas' heart danced. "Yes! Yes!" he cried, "and will
you love me if I win?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that I will," answered Ettarre laughing and flinging
away his hand as she peeped round to her knights and ladies
until they all laughed with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"O what a happy world!" thought glad Pelleas, "everybody
seems happy and I am the happiest of all."</p>

<p>He couldn't sleep that night for joy and on the next day
when he was knighted he swore to love one maiden only.
As he came away from the king's hall the men who met
him all turned around to look at his face, for it flamed with
happiness, and at the great banquets which Arthur gave to
knights from all parts of the country Pelleas looked the noblest
of the noble. For he dreamed that his lady loved him and
he knew that he was loved by the king.</p>

<p>On the morning when the jousts began the first that was
called was the tournament of youth. Arthur wanted to
keep the older, stronger men out of it so that young Pelleas
might win his lady's love as she had promised, and be lord
of the tourney. Down by the field along the river Usk where
it was held the gilded parapets were crowned with faces and
the great tower filled with eyes up to its top. Then the
trumpets blew for the tournament to begin.</p>

<p>All day long Sir Pelleas held the field. At the close a shout
rang round the galleries as Ettarre caught the gold crown
from his lance and crowned herself before all the people. Her
eyes sparkled as she looked at him, but that was the last time
she was kind to her knight.</p>

<p>She lingered a few days at Caerleon, sunny to all the other
people but always frowning at him.</p>

<p>Still when she left for home with her knights and maidens
Sir Pelleas followed.</p>

<p>"Damsels," cried she as she saw him coming, "I ought to be
ashamed to say it and yet I can't bear that Sir Baby. Keep
him back with yourselves. I'd rather have some rough old
knight who knows the ways of the world to chatter and joke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
with; so don't let him come near me. Tell him all sorts of
baby fables that good mothers tell their little boys, and if he
runs off for us&mdash;it doesn't matter."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus136.jpg" width="400" height="747" alt="ETTARRE CROWNED HERSELF BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE." title="ETTARRE CROWNED HERSELF BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE." />
<span class="caption">ETTARRE CROWNED HERSELF BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE.</span>
</div>

<p>So the young women didn't let him go near Ettarre but
made him stay with them, and as soon as they had all passed
into Ettarre's castle gate up sprang the drawbridge, down
rang the iron grating, and Sir Pelleas was left outside all alone.</p>

<p>"These are only the ways of ladies with their lovers when
the ladies want to find out whether the lovers are true or not.
Well, she can try me with anything, I'll be true through all."</p>

<p>So he stayed there until dark, then went to a priory not far
off and the next morning came back. Every day he did the
same whether it rained or shone, armed on his charger, and
stayed all the day beneath the walls, although nobody opened
the gate for him.</p>

<p>This made Ettarre's scorn turn to anger. She told her three
knights to go out and drive him away. But when they came
out Pelleas overthrew them all as they dashed upon him one
after the other. So they went back inside and he kept his
watch as before. This turned Ettarre's anger into hate. As
she walked on top of the walls with her three knights about a
week later she pointed down to Pelleas and said:</p>

<p>"He haunts me, look, he besieges me! I can't breathe.
Strike him down, put my hate into your blows and drive
him away from my walls."</p>

<p>So down they went but Pelleas overthrew them all again
so Ettarre called down from the tower above, "Bind him and
bring him in."</p>

<p>Pelleas heard her say this so he did not resist, but let the
men bind him and take him into his lady love. "See me, Lady,"
he said cheerily, "your prisoner, and if you keep me in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
dungeon here I'll be quite content if you'll just let me see your
face every day. For I've sworn my vows and you've given
me your promise and I know that when you've done proving
me you will give me your love and have me for your knight."</p>

<p>But she made fun of his vows and told her knights to put
him outside again and "if he isn't a fool to the middle of his
bones," said she, "he'll never come back." Then the three
knights laughed and thrust him out of the gates.</p>

<p>But a week later Ettarre called them again, "He's watching
there yet. He comes just like a dog that's been kicked out of
his master's door. Don't you hate him? Go after him, all
of you at once, and if you don't kill him bind him as you did
before and bring him in."</p>

<p>So the three knights couched their spears all together, three
against one, ready to dash upon Pelleas, low down beneath
the shadow of the towers.</p>

<p>Gawain passing by on a lonely adventure saw them.</p>

<p>"The villains!" he shouted to Pelleas, "I'll strike for you!"</p>

<p>"No," cried Pelleas, "when one's doing a lady's will one
doesn't need any help."</p>

<p>Gawain stood by quivering to fight while the three knights
sprang down upon Pelleas, but Pelleas all alone beat the three
of them together. Then they rose to their feet, and he stood
still while they bound him and took him into their lady.</p>

<p>"You're scarcely fit to touch your victor, you dogs!" she
cried to her men, "far less bind him; but take him out as he
is and let whoever wants to untie him. Then if he comes
again&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused just a minute and Pelleas broke in at once with,
"Lady, I loved you and thought you very beautiful, but if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
don't love me don't trouble yourself about it; you won't see
me again."</p>

<p>As soon as Pelleas was put outside the gate Gawain sprang
forward, loosed his bonds, flung them over the walls and cried
out:</p>

<p>"My faith, and why did you let those wretches tie you up
so when you were victor of all the jousts?"</p>

<p>"O," said Pelleas, "they were just obeying the wishes of my
lady, and her wishes are mine."</p>

<p>Gawain laughed. "Lend me your horse and armor," he
said, "and I'll tell her I've killed you. Then she'll let me in
just to hear all about it and when I've made her listen I'll
tell her all about you, what a great and good fellow you are.
Give me three days to melt her and on the third evening I'll
bring you golden news."</p>

<p>"Don't betray me," cried Pelleas, as he handed over his
horse and all his weapons except his sword. "Aren't you the
knight they call 'Light-of-love?'"</p>

<p>"That is just because women are so light," Gawain rejoined,
laughing.</p>

<p>Then he rode up to the castle gate, and blew the bugle so
musically that all the hidden echoes in the walls rang out.</p>

<p>"Away with you!" cried Ettarre's maidens, running up to
the tower window. "Our lady doesn't love you."</p>

<p>"I'm Gawain from Arthur's court," cried Gawain, lifting
his vizor so that they could see his face. "I've killed Pelleas
whom you hate so. Open the gates and I'll make you merry
with my story."</p>

<p>The ladies ran down crying out to Ettarre, "Pelleas is dead!
Sir Gawain of Arthur's court has killed him and is blowing
the bugle to come in to tell us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let him in," said Ettarre.</p>

<p>Then they opened the gates and Gawain rode inside.</p>

<p>For three days Pelleas wandered all about, doing nothing
but thinking of Gawain and Ettarre, and on the third night,
when Gawain did not come, he wondered why Gawain lingered
with his golden news. At last he rode up to Ettarre's castle,
tied his horse outside and walked in through the wide open
gates. The court he found all dark and empty, not a light
glimmering from anywhere, so he passed out by the back gate,
into the large gardens beyond of red and white roses, where he
saw three pavilions. In one he found the three knights with
their squires, all red with revelling, and all asleep, in the second
he saw the girls with their scornful smiles frozen stiff in
slumber, and in the third lay Gawain with Ettarre, the golden
crown he had won for her at the joust on her forehead, both
sleeping.</p>

<p>Pelleas drew back as if he had touched a snake.</p>

<p>"I'll kill them just as they lie," he cried in a passion. "O!
to think that any knight could be so false!"</p>

<p>But he was too manly to kill anyone in sleep, so he just laid
his sword across their throats and passed out to his horse,
crushed his saddle with his thighs, clenched his hands together
and groaned.</p>

<p>"I loathe her now just as much as I loved her!" he cried,
and dashing his spurs into his horse he bounded out into the
darkness and never came back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ettarre, feeling the cold sword on her neck,
awoke.</p>

<p>"Liar!" she cried to Gawain, as she saw that it was the sword
of Pelleas, "you haven't killed Pelleas, for he's been here and
could have killed us both just now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>And ever after that, as those who tell the story say, the proud
and scornful Ettarre sighed for Pelleas, the one true knight in
the world, her only faithful lover, and at last pined away because
he never came back.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAST_TOURNAMENT" id="THE_LAST_TOURNAMENT"></a>THE LAST TOURNAMENT.</h2>


<p>One day while King Arthur and Sir Lancelot were riding
far, far beneath a winding wall of rock they heard the wail
of a child.</p>

<p>A half-dead oak tree climbed up the sides of the rock and
up in mid-air it held an eagle's nest. Through its branches
rushed a rainy wind and through the wind came the voice of
a little child. Lancelot sprang up the crag and from the nest
at the tree-top he brought down a baby girl. Round her neck
was twined a necklace of rubies, wound round and round three
times.</p>

<p>Arthur took the baby and gave it to Queen Guinevere, who
soon loved it very tenderly and named her "Nestling." But
Nestling had caught a terrible cold in her strange little home
in the wild eagle's nest and died. And after that whenever
the Queen looked at the ruby necklace it made her very sad
so she gave it to Arthur and said:</p>

<p>"Take these jewels of our Dead Innocence and make them
a prize at a tournament."</p>

<p>"Just as you wish," cried the King, "but why don't you
wear the diamonds that I found for you in the tarn, which
Lancelot won for you at the jousts?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know that they slipped out of my hands the
very day that he gave them to me, while I was leaning out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the window to see Elaine in the barge on the river? But these
rubies will bring better luck than that to the lady who gets
them, for they didn't come from a dead king's skeleton, but
from the body of a sweet baby girl. Perhaps, who knows, the
purest of your knights will win them at the jousts for the
purest of my ladies."</p>

<p>So the great jousts were proclaimed with trumpets that blew
all along the streets of Camelot and out across the faded fields
to the farthest towers, and everywhere the knights armed
themselves for a day of glory before the king.</p>

<p>But just the day before they were to be held, as King
Arthur sat in his great hall, a churl staggered in through the
door; his face was all striped with the lashes of a dog whip,
his nose was broken, one eye was out, a hand was off and the
other hand dangled at his side with shattered fingers.</p>

<p>"My poor Churl," cried the king, full of indignant pity,
"what beast or fiend has been after you? Or was it a man
who hurt you so?"</p>

<p>"He took them all away," sputtered the churl, "a hundred
good ones. It was the Red Knight. He&mdash;Lord, I was tending
sheep, my pigs, a hundred good ones, and he drove them
all off to his tower. And when I said that you were always
kind to poor churls like me as well as gentle lords and ladies,
he made for me and would have killed me outright if he didn't
want me to bring you message and made me swear that I would
tell you.</p>

<p>"He said, 'Tell the king that I have made a Round Table
of my own in the North, and that whatever his knights swear
not to do mine swear that they will do; and tell him his hour
has come, and that the heathen are after him, and that his long
lance is broken, and that his sword Excalibur is a straw.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Arthur turned to Sir Kay the Seneschal and said:
"Take this churl of mine and tend him very carefully as if he
were the son of a king until all his hurts are healed," and as
Sir Kay left the hall with the churl the king went on to Lancelot:
"The heathen have been quiet for a long, long time,
but now they are rising again in the North, and I will go with
my younger knights to put them down, so as to make the
whole island safe from one shore to the other. And while I go
away, you, Sir Lancelot, will sit in my chair to-morrow at the
tournament and be the judge there of the field. For why
should you anyway care to go in again yourself, when you've
already won the nine diamonds for the queen?"</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Lancelot, "if you wish, although it
would be better if you would let me go off with the younger
knights and you stay here with the others and watch the tournament.
But, if not, all is well?"</p>

<p>"Is all really well?" cried the king, "or have I just dreamed
that our knights are not quite so true and manly as they used
to be and that my noble realm which has been built up by
noble deeds and noble vows is going to fall back into beastly
roughness and violence again?"</p>

<p>He gathered all the younger Knights of the Round Table
together and started away with them down the hilly streets
of Camelot, and at the gateway turned sharply North.</p>

<p>The next morning, the day of the Tournament, the Tournament
of the Dead Innocence they called it, a wet wind blew.
But the streets were hung with white samite, the fountains
were filled with wine, and round each fountain twelve little
girls, all dressed in purest white sat with the cups of gold and
gave drinks to all that passed. The stately galleries were
filled with white-robed ladies. Lancelot mounted the steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to the king's dragon-carved chair, the trumpets blew and the
jousts began.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus144.jpg" width="400" height="441" alt="TWELVE LITTLE GIRLS GAVE DRINK TO ALL WHO PASSED." title="TWELVE LITTLE GIRLS GAVE DRINK TO ALL WHO PASSED." />
<span class="caption">TWELVE LITTLE GIRLS GAVE DRINK TO ALL WHO PASSED.</span>
</div>

<p>But Lancelot did not think of the sport before him, he was
dreaming over and over again the words of the king about the
kingdom, and many rules of the tournament were broken, and
he didn't say a word. Once one of the knights, who was overthrown
cursed the little baby girl, the dead innocence, and
the king, and once one of the knight's helmets became unlaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and the wicked face of Modred peeped through like a
vermin, but Lancelot didn't see.</p>

<p>After a while a roar of welcome shouted all round the galleries
and lists as a new knight came in dressed from his head
to his feet in green armor all trimmed with tiny silver deer,
with holly berries on his helmet crest. It was Sir Tristram
of the Woods who had just crossed over the seas from Brittany.
Lancelot had fought with him long ago and conquered him,
and now he saw him and longed to fight him again. As many,
many knights of the Round Table fell down before the new
knight Lancelot gripped the golden dragons on each side of
his throne to keep himself in his seat, and groaned with passion.
"Craven crests! oh, shame!" he muttered, "the glory of the
Round Table is gone."</p>

<p>So Tristram won the jousts and Sir Lancelot gave him the
jewels.</p>

<p>"The hands with which you take these rubies are red," he
said as he put the necklace in Tristram's hands.</p>

<p>Then the thick rain began to fall, the plumes on the helmets
of the knights drooped and the dresses of the ladies were mussed.
When they went inside to feast the ladies took off their pure
white gowns and robed themselves in all the colors of the
rainbow and field flowers, like poppies, blue-bells, kingcups,
and one said she was glad the time to wear the pure innocent
simple white was over. They grew so loud in their frolics
that at last the queen, who was angry that Sir Tristram had
won the prize and angry with the lawless youths, broke up the
banquet.</p>

<p>The next morning as Sir Tristram stood before the hall little
Dagonet, the fool, came dancing along and Sir Tristram threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
his rubies round the little fool's neck as he skipped about like
a withered leaf, asking him why he danced.</p>

<p>"It's stupid to dance
without music," Tristram
said, and picked up his harp
and began to twangle a tune
on it; but as soon as Sir
Tristram began to play
Dagonet stopped his dance.
"And why don't you go on
skipping, Sir Fool?" asked
Tristram.</p>

<p>"Because I'd rather skip
twenty years to the music
of my little brain than skip
a minute to the broken music
you make."</p>

<p>"And what music have I
broken?" cried Sir Tristram.
"Arthur the King's
music," cried little Dagonet,
skipping again and again as
Sir Tristram ceased. Then
down the city he danced all the way, while Sir Tristram
passed out into the lonely avenues of the forests. He rode
on toward Lyonesse and the West, thinking of Isolt, the
White, whom he loved, and how he would put the rubies
round her neck.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">LITTLE DAGONET SKIPPING AGAIN AND AGAIN.</span>
</div>

<p>Arthur, meanwhile, with his hundred spearmen had gone
far, far away, until at last over the countless reeds of marshes
and islands he saw a huge tower glaring in the wide-winged
sunset of the West. As he drew near he saw that the tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
doors stood open and heard roars of rioting and wicked songs
of ruffian men and women.</p>

<p>"Look," cried one of his knights, for there high on a grim
dead tree before the tower, a brother of the Round Table was
swinging by his neck, his shield flowing with a shower of blood
on a branch near by.</p>

<p>All the knights wanted to dash forward and blow the great
horn that hung beside the gate, but Arthur waved them back
and went himself. He blew so hard that the horn roared until
all the grasses of the marshes flared up, and out of the castle
gate sallied a knight dressed from tip to toe in blood-red
arms, the Red Knight.</p>

<p>"Aren't you the king?" he bellowed, "the king that keeps
us all with such strict vows that we can't have any pleasures,
a milky-hearted king? Look to your life now!"</p>

<p>Arthur scorned to speak to so vile a man or to fight him with
his sword. He simply let the drunkard, stretching out from
his horse to strike, fall head-heavy, over from the castle causeway
to the swamp below.</p>

<p>Then all the Round Table Knights roared and shouted,
leaped down on the fallen man, trampled out his face in the
mire, sank his head so that it could not be seen, and, still
shouting, sprang through the open doors among the people
within. They hurled their swords right and left on men and
women, hurled over the tables and the wines and slew and
slew until all the rafters rang with yells and all the pavements
streamed with blood. Then they set the tower all afire and half
the night through it flushed the long low meadows and marshlands
and lazily plunging sea with its flames. That was how
Arthur made the ways of the island safe from one shore to the
other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Tristram, not many nights after, reached Tintagil, where
Isolt, the White, lived in a crown of towers, where she now sat
with the low sea-sunset glorying her hair and glossy throat,
thinking of him and of Mark, her Cornish lord.</p>

<p>When Tristram's footsteps came grinding up the tower
steps she flushed, started out to meet him and threw her white
arms about him.</p>

<p>"Not Mark, not Mark!" she cried. "At first your footsteps
fluttered me, for Mark steals into his own castle like a cat."</p>

<p>"No, it's I," said Sir Tristram, "and don't think about your
Mark any more, for he isn't yours any longer."</p>

<p>"But listen," she cried, "to-day he went away for a three
days' hunt, he said, and that means that he may be back in
an hour for that's his way. My God, my hate for him is as
strong as my love for you. Let me tell you how I sat here
one evening thinking of you, one black midsummer night,
all alone, dreaming of you, and sometimes speaking your name
aloud, when suddenly there Mark stood behind me, for that's
his way to steal behind one in the dark.</p>

<p>"'Tristram has married her!' he hissed out and then this
tower shook with such a roar that I swooned away."</p>

<p>"Come," cried Sir Tristram, laughing, "never mind, I'm
hungry, give me some meat and wine."</p>

<p>So they ate and drank, talked and laughed about Mark with
his long crane-like legs, and Sir Tristram took a harp and sang
a song. Then while the last light of the day glimmered away
he swung the ruby necklace before Isolt.</p>

<p>"It's the fruit of a magical oak-tree that grew mid air," he
cried, "and was won by Sir Tristram as a tourney prize to
bring to you."</p>

<p>Flinging the rubies round her neck he had just touched her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
jeweled throat with his lips when behind him rose a shadow
and a shriek.</p>

<p>"Mark's way!" cried Mark, the Cornish king, and he clove
Tristram through the brain.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That very night Arthur came back from the North, and as
he climbed up the tower steps to go to the queen, in the dark
of the tower something pulled at him. It was little Dagonet.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said the king.</p>

<p>"I'm little Dagonet, your fool," sobbed the little jester,
"and I cry because I can never make you laugh again."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_PASSING_OF_ARTHUR" id="THE_PASSING_OF_ARTHUR"></a>THE PASSING OF ARTHUR.</h2>


<p>One night King Arthur saw Sir Gawain in a dream, and
Gawain, who had been killed, shrilly called out to him through
the wind:</p>

<p>"Hail King! to-morrow you are going to pass away, and
there's a land of rest for you. Farewell!"</p>

<p>But when Arthur told his dream to Sir Bedivere, good old
Sir Bedivere replied, "Don't mind what dreams tell you, but
get your knights together and go out to the West to meet Sir
Modred, who has stirred up against you so many of the knights
you love. They all know in their hearts that you are king.
Go and conquer them as of old."</p>

<p>So the king took his army by night and pushed upon Modred
league after league, until they reached the Western part of
Lyonesse where the long mountains ended in the moaning
sea. There Modred's men could flee no farther, so on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
waste lands by the barren sea they began that last dim weird
battle of the West.</p>

<p>A white chill mist slept over all the land and water so that
even Arthur became confused since he could not see which were
his friends and which were his foes. Friends killed friends,
some saw the faces of old ghosts looking in upon the battle.
Spears were splintered, shields were broken, swords clashed,
helmets were shattered, men shrieked and looked up to heaven
for help but saw only the white, white mists. There were
cries for light and moans.</p>

<p>At last toward the close of the day a hush fell over the whole
shore; a bitter wind from the North blew the mist aside and
the pale king looked across the battlefield. But no one was
there only the waves breaking in among the dead faces.</p>

<p>But bold Bedivere said: "My King! the man who hates
you stands there, Modred, the traitor of your house!"</p>

<p>"Don't call this traitor a person of my house," the king
replied. "The men of my house are not those who have
lived under one roof with me, but those who always call me
their king."</p>

<p>With that, Arthur dashed after Modred. Modred struck
at the king's helmet, which had grown thin with all his
heathen wars. Arthur with his sword Excalibur struck
Modred dead, then fell down himself almost killed with the
wound through his helmet.</p>

<p>Sir Bedivere lifted him up and carried him to a chapel near
by.</p>

<p>"Take my sword, Excalibur," said the King, "and fling
it out into the middle of the sea, watch what happens to it and
then come back at once and tell me."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem right to leave you all alone here," said Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Bedivere, "when you are wounded and ill, but since you wish
me to go, I will, and will do all that you have told me."</p>

<p>He slipped away by zigzag paths, points and jutting rock
to the shining level of the sea. There he drew out the sword
Excalibur. The winter moon sparkled against its hilt and
made it twinkle with its diamond sparks, with myriads of
topaz lights and fine jewelry work. Bedivere gazed so long
at it that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood, and he wondered
whether he ought to throw away so beautiful a thing.
At last he decided to hide it away among the water-flags that
grew along shore.</p>

<p>"Did you do as I said?" asked the king, when he saw him.
"What did you see?"</p>

<p>"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds," said Sir Bedivere,
"and the wild water lapping on the rock."</p>

<p>"You are not giving me a true answer," said the king,
faint and pale. "It's shameful for men to lie. Quickly go
again and as you are true and dear, do just as I bade you.
Watch and bring me word."</p>

<p>Then Sir Bedivere went the second time and paced up and
down beside the pebbly water, counting the dewey pebbles,
but when he saw the wonderful sword he clapped his hands
together and cried:</p>

<p>"If I threw that sword away, a precious thing will be lost
forever. The King is ill; he does not know what he is doing.
His great sword ought to be kept, then in long years hereafter
people will look at it at the tournament and they will say:
'This was the great Arthur's sword Excalibur which was made
by the lonely lady of the Lake, working in the deep sea for nine
years.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>So the second time he hid Excalibur and strode very slowly
back to the king.</p>

<p>"What did you see or what did you hear?" asked Arthur
breathing very heavily.</p>

<p>"I heard the water lapping on the rock and the long
ripples washing in the reeds."</p>

<p>"Unkind! miserable! untrue! unknightly!" cried Arthur,
filled with anger. "I see what you are, for you are the only
one left me of all the knights, yet you would betray me for my
sword, either to sell it or like a girl, because you love its beauty.
Go out now the third time and if you do not throw out my
sword Excalibur I'll get up and kill you with my hands."</p>

<p>At this Sir Bedivere sprang up like a flash and ran down
leaping lightly over the ridges, plunged into the beds of bulrushes,
clutched the sword, wheeled it round strongly and
threw it as far as he could.</p>

<p>Excalibur made lightning in the moonlight as it flashed
round and round and whirled in an arch, shooting far out to
the water. But before it quite dipped into the sea an arm
robed in white samite, mystic and wonderful, rose out of the
waves, caught it by the hilt, brandished it three times and
drew it under.</p>

<p>"Now I can see by your eyes that you have done it!" cried
the King. "Speak out; what have you seen or heard?"</p>

<p>"Sir King," cried Sir Bedivere, "I closed my eyes when I
picked it up so that I would not be turned from my purpose
of throwing it into the water, for I could live three lives, Sir
King, and I wouldn't again see such a wonderful thing as your
sword. Sir, I threw it out with both hands, wheeling it round
and when I looked an arm robed in white samite reached up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
out of the water and caught it by the hilt, brandished it three
times and drew it under."</p>

<p>"Carry me to the shore," said the king.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus153.jpg" width="400" height="367" alt="AN ARM ROBED IN WHITE SAMITE." title="AN ARM ROBED IN WHITE SAMITE." />
<span class="caption">AN ARM ROBED IN WHITE SAMITE.</span>
</div>

<p>So Bedivere lifted him up and walked as swiftly as he could
from the ridge, heavily, heavily down to the beach. As they
reached the shore they saw a black barge beside the water
filled with stately people all dressed in black. Among the people
were three queens wearing crowns of gold.</p>

<p>"Put me into the barge," cried Arthur.</p>

<p>So they came to the barge and the three queens held out
their hands and took the king.</p>

<p>The tallest and fairest of them held his head upon her lap
loosed his shattered helmet and chafed his hands, and moaned
tenderly over him.</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord Arthur," cried Sir Bedivere, "where shall I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
now? For the old times are past now and the whole Round
Table is broken."</p>

<p>"Go and pray," cried the king. "Farewell, for I am going
a very long way to the lovely Island-valley of Avilion where
it will never hail nor rain nor snow, and where the loud winds
never blow. It lies in deep meadows, beautiful with lawns
and fruit trees and flowery glens."</p>

<p>Then the barge set sail and oar, and moved away from the
shore.</p>

<p>"The king is gone!" groaned Bedivere.</p>

<p>He walked away from the shore and climbed up to the
highest peaks and ridges about him and looked far, far away.
And from far away out beyond the world he thought he heard
sounds from a beautiful city as if every one in it all together
were welcoming a great King who had just come back from
his wars.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
